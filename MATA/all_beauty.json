With that out of the way, this stuff is what I've been searching for for a very long time. I almost didn't purchase it as I have spent a small fortune and resigned myself to the belief that what I'm after doesn't exist. Thankfully it does and this is it!\n\nI have tried so many beard waxes and all have left something to be desired. I have been searching for a beard wax that was as firm as possible while still actually being useable in the beard. What I found were ones with either laughable hold or were so firm that they were unusable in the beard and should only be considered a stache wax. I have also found a couple that are pretty good though the hold doesn't last for more than an hour or so.\n\nIn comes The Bearded Goon's Ridiculously Strong Beard and Mustache Wax which has an incredibly firm hold. So firm that this is one step away from being solely a stache style wax. And, it's still useable in the beard. It takes a little effort scrapping it out with a thumbnail but still doable. A little hand rub heat makes it ready for beard application. Hitting it with a blow dryer makes this process even easier, if you have the time for that. I recommend having your beard damp with hot water, this seems to help with application and styling also.\n\nHere's the best part, it lasts, all day! Hell your beard actually still looks good in the morning or just needs a little hand smoothing. This goes for maintenance also. If it does get a bit messed up just a quick smooth puts it right back. It also washes out just fine and smells great too. It has a very subtle clean scent that fades pretty quick, this is good.\n\nThis is a real beard wax folks with all natural, quality ingredients. No chemical crap here. You can't get any better, useably stronger or longer lasting than this and trust me I've looked. This is also not a balm or an oil, if you want a conditioning product buy one of those. This is a strong hold wax, and very good at its job! Very well done and thank you for this outstanding product!\n\nlet's just make it 2 ounces guys!", "Good", "This is NOT in anyway shape or form a ridiculously strong mustache wax, it's cheap and s***ty crap, don't buy it."],

The floating heads contour really well to my face, and I have experienced very little discomfort in shaving.  The pop-up trimmer is handy too.  It is amazing how long the battery lasts between charges.  I estimate I get about 18 days between charges.  There is an indicator on the handle that will signal a charge is needed.  Cleaning the blades as described in the owner's manual is a good idea.  Why did I pick this razor?  It was in my price range.  A friend at work liked his Norelco.  The color was acceptable.  At the time of purchase, there was a special offer that was appealing to me.", "I have had this razor for about 6 years now.  I use it daily and the original battery is still running strong.  I have never replaced the blades and that time has come as now I see the shave is not as close or quick.  I love the shave this razor gives and the battery life is phenomenal.

My last the 3612 just went haywire and stopped charging.  I should of known better.  It's made in China.\n\nNOW FOR THE NORELCO QUADRA! THIS IS NOT LIKE MY OLD NORELCO.\n\nI HAVE NEVER HAD A SHAVE THIS CLOSE!!!  THIS FAST!!!  THIS QUIET!!!  PERIOD!!!\n\nTHE FLOATING HEADS AND REFLEX ACTION IN COMBINATION WITH THE HOLES AND THE SLOTS WORK.  IT GLIDES ALONG YOUR FACE WITH HARDLY PRESSING AGAINST YOUR SKIN.  IT RINSES UNDER HOT WATER.  THE 7845XL HAS TWO LED LIGHTS ONE THAT BLINKS GREEN WHEN THE CHARGE IS FULL AND ONE THAT LIGHTS UP RED WHEN THE CHARGE IS LOW.  THERE ARE THREE OF THESE QUADRAS. THIS ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE.  BUT THEY ARE ALL THE SAME RAZOR EXCEPT FOR THE LED FEATURES.  MAKE SURE YOUR CHARGE THE FIRST TIME FOR FOUR HOURS. IT HAS A 60 DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE AND A TWO YEAR WARRANTY. MADE IN HOLLAND THIS SHAVER EVEN LOOKS AND FEELS LIKE A QUALITY PRODUCT.  I BOUGHT MINE FROM DRUGSTORE.COM WITH FREE 3 DAY SHIPPING AND GOT IT IN TWO.\n\nLOOK NO FURTHER THIS IS IT!!!

The shaver&#x92;s Lift and Cut shaving system uses 45 lifters and 45 rotating blades, so hair actually gets cut below the skin surface. A flexible surface and individually floating heads ensure that the shaver hugs your face&#x92;s contours and tackles both long and short stubble comfortably.

Charge time is speedy--just one hour of charging delivers 45 minutes of shave time, and a 6-minute quick charge takes care of emergencies. The nonslip grip is comfortable to hold, and the LED indicators let you know at a glance if charging&#x92;s finished or the battery juice is running low.

Hopefully Philips Norelco reads these reviews & gives us the option to purchase that.", "I purchased the BG2030 to replace my previous BodyGroomer that had died - the button no longer 'clicked' the machine on - based on previous reviews. When I received the machine I was impressed by how far Philips has evolved the BodyGroomer, and in contrast to other reviewers found the new trimming head and combs to be a welcome change. Not only are the combs more easily adjustable than the previous model and thus more accurate, but with one for 'sensitive' areas and the other for everything else it aides in maintaining high hygiene of the attachments. The only minor difficulty I had was with the charge light that did not function on my unit which Philips has agreed to replace - this did not affect the operation of the machine, but the CSR felt returning it was the appropriate way to handle the issue.\n\nOverall I would recommend the BG2030 for any 'man-scaping' that you need to do, only cautioning that if you need a truly bare result that you will have to use an additional razor to achieve the desired result. If well kept with a little stubble is all you are looking for then this machine will do the job and then some.", "I purchased this trimmer for trimming my underarms and more personal areas along with my beard.  it is amazing.  it is so gentle on the tender areas and has great comb control for my beard.

    "description": "The all-over Bodygrooming system, with specific trimming and shaving attachments, optimized for sensitive bodyzones\nTrim and shave all of your body zones safely and comfortably with the Philips Norelco Professional BodyGrooming System. This five-piece all-over system provides a perfect trim and smooth shave, even in extra-sensitive body zones. Rechargeable and cordless, this efficient system also comes with uniquely designed attachments, including an Extra Sensitive (XS) trimming comb, Extra Large (XL) trimming comb, trimming attachment, shaving attachment, and a store-and-charge stand.  .caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; }     The Bodygrooming System works both in the shower or out, wet or dry. View larger.     The Extra Sensitive attachment is perfect for areas like the groin, and the Extra Large works well for large areas like the chest and back. View larger.    Professional Results, Even in Sensitive Areas The Bodygrooming System takes trimming and shaving to a new level, so you can enjoy professional results at home. Its ergonomic design and separate trimming and shaving attachments offer an easy and painless way to achieve the look you want. You can also use it on all body zones, even your extra sensitive skin areas, such as your chest and abs, underarms, groin area, legs, back, and shoulders.         With the included trimming attachments, you can achieve the perfect look even in your most sensitive skin spots, including the groin area.        The hypoallergenic shaving foils gives you a close, comfortable shave with less irritation, even on the most sensitive skin and in the most sensitive areas.       The chromium stainless steel blades provide an ultra-close shave, and gives long-lasting performance that is maintenance-free!     Advanced Attachments For More Options The Bodygrooming System lets you control how much hair to remove with advanced attachments that offer dependable results. The Extra Sensitive (XS) trimming comb is specially designed for the groin area and underarms, while the Extra Large (XL) trimming comb works best in large areas like the chest and abs, legs, back and shoulders. You can also choose from five lock-in length settings for trimming without completely removing hair. When you're done, the attachments simply rinse clean for easy care. And for a close, smooth and complete shave, use the Bodygroomer System without any attachments. Expertly Handles Thick, Coarse Hair Men's body hair can be coarser than hair on the head and grow in multiple directions, making trimming or shaving certain body zones more challenging. With durable, self-sharpening, stainless steel blades that never need lubrication, and a hypoallergenic shaving foil that cuts with less irritation and protects against nicks and cuts, the Bodygrooming System is virtually maintenance free. This system is powerful enough to get through the thick, coarse hair areas, yet still gentle enough for your sensitive zones, and flexible enough to meet your unique grooming needs. Easy to Use Wet or Dry The Bodygrooming System is water-resistant, which makes it perfect for using in the shower. And if you prefer a dry cut, especially when you're trimming hair, this shaver works just as well dry. Whichever option is best for you, simply move the shaver against the direction of hair growth, stretching the skin when you move the shaving foil across it. The Bodygrooming System comes with a 45-day money back guarantee and a full two-year manufacturer's warranty.

    "description": "Driclor is for application to the axillae, palms of the hands or soles of the feet. Before applying aluminium chloride hexahydrate, the affected area should be dried thoroughly to avoid burning of the skin (see Warnings and Precautions). Apply Driclor last thing at night after drying the affected areas carefully. Wash off in the morning. Do not re-apply the product during the day. Initially the product may be applied each night until sweating stops during the day. The frequency of application may then be reduced to twice a week or less. Aluminium chloride hexahydrate reacts with water to produce hydrochloric acid. Therefore the areas to be treated should be completely dry before application to avoid skin burning. Application should be restricted to the affected area(s) only. Driclor should not be applied to skin that has been shaved within 12 hours or which is broken or irritated. Hair removal products should not be used on areas to be treated within 12 hours before or after applying Driclor. Avoid contact with eyes, nostrils, mouth or other mucous membranes. In case of accidental contact with the eyes or other mucous membranes, rinse well with water. Avoid direct contact with clothing, jewellery and polished metal surfaces. In the event of accidental oral ingestion rinse the mouth with plenty of water. Further management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by the national poisons centre, where available.",

I've tried every bladed razor imaginable from the Mach 3, Mach 3 Turbo, Mach 3 Fusion, Schick Quattro, to the other disposable units but the Norelco just does a better job.\n\nThe heads are easy to disassemble and clean and the combs get close enough to the skin that you get a baby-face smooth shave without irritation or pulling hairs.\n\nThe only negative aspect is the cost. After buying three of the HS85 heads (over 3 years), you have spent the equivalent money of buying another electric shaver.", "The blades I received were of the same quality as the original that came with the razor.\n\nI did have an issue with the original set of blades.

For the past year my current deoderant (Arrid XX Dry) will get me through about 3\/4 of the day, but by dinner time it's time for a reapplication.\n\nI was hoping that the clinical strength in this product would allow me to go with one application in the morning that would get me through the day.  Unfortuantely, my body handled this product just like the Arrid XX Dry.  I put it on in the morning and by 5PM it was time for a reapplication.\n\nHowever, just like the Arrid product there was no perspiration, just a little odor.  If sweating and moisture is your problem then this product is for you.  However, if you're like me and want to control the smell, then I'd save the extra money and just buy more Arrid because you're going to have to reapply both of them.", "I'm a longtime underarm sweater, and have had most success with Old Spice antiperspirants.  I decided to give this Gillette a shot, and needless to say, was a little disappointed.\n\nDoes it keep my drier?  Well, when used correctly (apply at night, which was hard to get used to) and not washing underneath my arms in the shower in the morning, it worked slightly better than what I'm used to.  The problem is, however, that it's not realistic.  Sure, I can get used to applying deodorant on at night.  But can I get used to NOT scrubbing underneath my arms during my morning shower?  Ummm...no.\n\nI tried the unscented kind, which was fine - literally no scent.  I experienced no irritation or any other kind of side effect from it.\n\nI ended up being slightly drier, but still sweaty using the Gillette.  I'm sure everyone is different, and maybe I'm a profuse sweater, but it just didn't work enough for me to justify the premium (costs over twice what I normally get for marginal results).\n\nIt might be worth a shot if you're desperately looking for a solution to underarm perspiration.  It's certainly a cheaper alternative than paying for $700 Botox injections every 6 months.  But don't expect this to be the answer to your prayers.  At least for me, it certainly wasn't.", "Wow.

View larger.     Why is Gillette Clinical Strength better? Gillette Clinical Strength Anti-Perspirant Deodorant is made for men who experience or worry about excessive underarm perspiration. Daily use provides them with better protection and more confidence that they have control over their perspiration and their lives. Its Triple-Protection Technology:  Provides prescription-strength wetness protection Contains odor-fighting microcapsules Contains skin-conditioning ingredients to help minimize irritation \nIs Gillette Clinical Strength for everyone? Gillette Clinical Strength is designed for heavy sweaters, but can provide confidence and prescription-strength protection to anyone who experiences or worries about excessive underarm perspiration.\nIs Gillette Clinical Strength doctor-recommended? More than 95-percent of doctors surveyed say they endorse the use of Gillette Clinical Strength to control excessive underarm perspiration and the problems associated with it.\nShould I use Gillette Clinical Strength differently? Gillette Clinical Strength can be effective when used as you use traditional anti-perspirants, but for optimal results, follow these instructions carefully:  Apply Gillette Clinical Strength at bedtime to minimize excess nighttime perspiration. An additional morning application is not necessary; you will be protected throughout the day, even if you bathe or shower after application. If you neglect to apply it at night, morning application will still provide strong protection.  Gillette Clinical Strength should be applied according to your personal needs. A light layer is recommended, and three clicks per arm is the average. But because Gillette Clinical Strength is so gentle on your skin, you may apply as much as you feel is necessary.  Most men find the nighttime application sufficient to control excessive wetness for the following day. However, if you feel more protection is needed, a morning reapplication of Gillette Clinical Strength, or the use of another anti-perspirant, is acceptable. \nHow is Gillette Clinical Strength better than a prescription underarm product?  Many prescription strength anti-perspirants contain the active ingredient aluminum chloride. Aluminum chloride is more acidic than the active ingredient in Gillette Clinical Strength. Research has shown that anti-perspirants which contain aluminum chloride can be irritating to the underarm skin. In fact, the skin irritation is often so severe that discontinued use is required. In addition, aluminum chloride can be damaging to some clothing, often causing staining and\/or discoloration.\nGillette Clinical Strength does not contain aluminum chloride. In fact, its patented formula contains powerful Triple Protection Technology with skin conditioning ingredients that will help minimize irritation.\nHow does Gillette Clinical Strength provide 34-percent better wetness protection than a prescription product (6.25-percent AlCl3)? Gillette Clinical Strength was tested in two 10-day clinical studies against a current marketed prescription anti-perspirant. Subjects had product applied to their underarms everyday for nine days. Both products were applied at bedtime as current marketed prescription products instruct to \"apply at night.\" In both studies, Gillette Clinical Strength performed significantly better than the prescription product for providing wetness protection throughout the study. Overall, the clinical studies resulted in Gillette Clinical Strength providing 34-percent better wetness protection than a prescription product.\nWhy do we perspire?  Sweating is your bodys way of releasing excess heat and cooling itself. Sweating is natural under any condition, but sweating can be intensified by any number of elements, including warm weather, exercise and stress.\n   Bedtime application gives you effective protection the following day.   How much perspiration is too much? Excessive sweating is not fully understood and can be related to any number of medical or physiological conditions, including hyperhidrosis. Only you can decide if your sweating is excessive. Gillette Clinical Strength is designed to provide protection for anyone who feels embarrassed by his perspiration, or unable to control it.\nWhat is an anti-perspirant?  Anti-perspirants block the flow of sweat from sweat glands, thus reducing wetness. Because perspiration stimulates odor-causing bacteria, anti-perspirant also reduces body odor. Additionally, most anti-perspirants are scented, so they fight odor even more.\nHow does anti-perspirant work? Anti-perspirants use sweat against itself. Once applied, the anti-perspirant is dissolved by sweat, and the dissolved anti-perspirant particles form superficial plugs just below the skins surface. These plugs block the release of more perspiration. Generally, the plugs will stay in place for about 24 hours and are then washed away over time.\nIf sweating is natural, will this product be too strong and affect my body's ability to cool itself? Absolutely not! Reducing sweating in the underarm has virtually no effect on the body's ability to cool itself. The number of sweat glands in the underarms represents a very small area of the body. There are many sweat glands on other parts of your body. So, the vast majority of your body heat is released from other parts of your body.\nWhy should I use Gillette Clinical Strength at bedtime? At night, your bodys temperature and sweat rate slow. By applying Gillette Clinical Strength as this is occurring, little or no anti-perspirant is washed away by sweat, and you ensure great effectiveness of the plugs. Applied at night, Gillette Clinical Strength is so effective that morning reapplication is not even required, though it is permissible. ",

The hot wax spurted out of the container as soon as I tried to gently mix it after only 30 seconds in the microwave (per the directions), which managed to ruin my tee shirt and burn my left hand, splatter all over my counters and floors. This is pro grade wax so there is no real solution to removing the wax other than scrubbing - your skin and any surface it lands on. The 'wax removal' lotion the kit includes is a joke. If I could give this negative stars I would - I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in a product. I managed to remove some leg hair but frankly the hour and a half I spent cleaning wax off my skin and my kitchen is not worth the effort, nor is the ruined tee shirt or the burn on my left hand.", "Works fine but I wouldn't use it for the bikini line and further, makes the skin very tender.

Her hair length is about 3-4 inches below her shoulders. I told her that she probably needed more then one bottle. So she decided to do half her hair black and half this Aqua color. It ended up that about 2\/3 of her hair is black and only the crown of her head extending about 4-5 inches from the top was going to be aqua. But the one bottle didn't even completely cover that much of her hair, nor was it the vibrant color on the packaging. Before I procede allow me to add that my mom, who went to beauty school and owned her own salon, was the one doing the dying at my daughters request after she bought it. While it does say on the packaging that longer hair may require more then one bottle it is still falsely adverstising the brightness of the color, and yes it was bleached first, as well as the coverage. Almost all the female models pictured on their packages have long hair. I can guestimate that you will need 6-8 bottles for that length of hair and thickness. The bottles are only half the size of those you find in other hair dye kits. It was a complete disappointment after spending her Christmas money to end up like this. The stuff isn't cheap.", "It doesn't seem to want to stay in any type of hair, I love the colors and selection but I can pay less for something that will stay in my hair", "This was the first time I'd ever bleached or colored my hair.  I have somewhat thin, light brown, long, wavy hair that I never, ever blow dry, straighten, or curl.\n\nI decided on the aqua color after looking up videos of people dying their hair on youtube and seeing the process and results there.  I ended up with Splat because, for the amount of hair that I actually wanted to dye (just some streaks, not my whole head), it was the most cost-efficient, since it includes bleach in the kit.\n\nThe bleach was not particularly strong.  I bleached my hair for about 45 minutes the first time, and it brought my hair to a dirty blonde.  I decided to go lighter and did another 45 minutes later and got to a very light blonde, but definitely not platinum by any means.  My hair, since it's thin, was pretty weak and a little stretchy after that, but it's bleach and that's what happens.  I decided that it was light enough, and it recovered within a week with some care and conditioning.\n\nI knew my hair wouldn't absorb the dye that well, so I left the dye in for about 50 minutes the first time I dyed it, and it came out great.  I was very excited about the color-- more green than what's shown on the box, but still a strong aqua.  The color only ran for a few days after I dyed it, and not in large amounts.  I did get some on a pillow when I absent-mindedly let my wet hair sit on it after a shower, but within a week, my clothes and other cloth items were safe.  It faded into a turqoise-green pretty quickly, however, and about three weeks later I decided to re-dye it.  Again, the color was awesome, but again, it faded into a light, turquoise-green.  The color is still noticeable, but it is nowhere near as bright or strong as the first couple weeks I had it.  I'm kind of fond of it, though, since it looks much more \"natural\" (as natural as green gets!)."],

This Cleansing Milk contains soap-free, botanical cleansers that gently lift away grime without drying or stripping skin.As skin ages and its cellular metabolism slows, collagen and elastin production gradually deteriorates causing wrinkles and sagging. This slowed metabolism is due in part to a decline in the skin's natural levels of Co-Enzyme Q10 and other energy sources. Studies show that supplementing the skin's natural CoQ10 production can help reverse and prevent these visible signs of aging. Wrinkle Therapy features a carefully selected blend of powerful natural wrinkle fighters. CoQ10 will boost skin energy levels to encourage regrowth of collagen and elastin; Rosehip Oil, high in potent antioxidants, provides intense free radical defense and promotes healthy skin rejuvenation; Hyaluronic Acid helps skin attract and retain moisture, resulting in a dewy, resilient and smoother surface texture. When skin is re-energized and its natural defenses are reinforced, it becomes firmer and more elastic, the appearance of lines and wrinkles fade and its overall complexion appears more youthful and healthy. Avalon Organics is grounded in the knowledge that all beauty begins within the Earth. Guided by the wisdom of nature, each product is thoughtfully crafted for optimal effectiveness while meeting a strict organic standard. Formulas contain carefully selected botanicals that are nurtured by the elements then tenderly harvested to nourish the body from the outside in.

I have only thinning hair and have to apply a lot compared to the you tube video. perhaps the black color that is in the videos has better coverage than dark brown.

I use Bare Minerals powder make up and having been searching for a long time for a set of brushes that I actually enjoy using with this make up. I have had a couple sets before this and the biggest turn off to a set is when they come smelling like chemicals.  However, this set of brushes came out scent free! There are actually a few details that I find quite unique that make this set stand out:\n\n-The handles: this actually really surprised me at first. The necks of these brushes bend! When I first used them I was amazed that when I pushed a little too hard the brush gave and flexed rather than pushing back.\n-The head: I also like that the head is perpendicular to the base, rather than straight out. I find this takes slightly different muscles to control the bushes, but this angle makes way more sense to me.\n-The bristles- these are firmer- or maybe what I mean is that the bristles are denser?- than other brushes I've used. Despite the density, they are extremely soft and very responsive when I'm brushing my Bare Minerals make up on.\n- The different shapes and sizes: I love how much variety there is in this set. While I don't know exactly what I would use each shape for yet, I love the variety and how much more control it gives me over when my make up goes on my face.\n\nOverall, I'm very happy with this set of makeup brushes and it makes me excited to put make up in the mornings!\n\nI received these brushes for free for my honest and unbiased review."],

This oil has a strong smell but sweet like any other Indian herbal oils. My husband has new hair growth on areas of scalp where hair didn't exist for couple of months. His hair also looks thicker than before.\nHe uses this oil 2-3 times a week and massages his scalp gently with his fingers for 5-10 minutes. He leaves the oil on the hair overnight and washes it off with shampoo in the morning. I use this oil once once a week.\nI would definitely recommend an old t-shirt or a thick old pillow cover to put on the pillow, so that the oil from the hair does not soil the pillow. Also covering the head with a scarf or cap helps the oil to be absorbed better by the scalp.\nAnother good thing is that the base of the oil is sesame oil and not mineral oil like in many other hair oils.\nIt has a calming effect and helps me to sleep better. I would totally recommend it to anyone wanting healthy hair and better sleep."],

Great value for the money.", "I ordered this because I already have one in earthtone colors which I use frequently, and I liked the red too. This is what I have found by trial and error to be helpful in using this style of burner for aromatic oil diffusion(I have never used it with wax, so can't comment on that)\n*I first add a total of about 15-25 drops of oil first--then hang the diffuser (you can easily and gently adjust the bend in the suspending wire if necessary to keep the liquid level) I then fill the reservoir with  just enough water so it doesn't slop out and waste my oils and make a mess. You will learn the right amount.  If you don't have a steady hand, add your water (a small watering can or plastic water bottle work well) after placing the diffuser where you want to end up lighting it.\n* I mix a few drops of 2 to 4 different oils, depending on my mood and how strong the aromas are.  There really is no wrong combination if you like the individual oils themselves.  If you don't know which ones to start with, get one of the sampler kits with 6 small bottles of basic oils in it to  find out your preferences and how much you want to use.  My basic mix usually has about 10 drops of peppermint, 4 drops of lavender, 6 drops of eucalyptus and a little lemon oil.  Or not. That's really the point--this process is not a chemistry experiment or gourmet recipe that will be messed up if you don't put in the exact amounts and types of oils in the proper sequence. I guess I also like a stronger fragrance than some people.  If you must follow directions, exactly, try one of the many books about aromatherapy, or talk with a helpful health food store employee--but I suggest waiting until after you've done some basic experimenting on your own.  The effects of oils can be different in different people, so pay attention to how you're feeling  and don't get tenser if a \"stress reducer\" doesn't, for example. Have fun with it. Explore the possible health benefits.  Find different ways to use the oils(this is where the books and advice help.)\n*Tea lights work best-no votives; they're too hot.  If you notice any smoking (I never have) or the liquid dries up before the candle goes out (unusual with the right water to oil mixture) just add a little  more water.\n* These oils generally are not intended for human consumption--it's been a long time since my son tried to consume everything he could get his little hands on, but if I do ever have grandchildren (hmm..... maybe with the right oils as a Christmas present?)  I'd keep this stuff out of reach."],

Smelled great, moisturized, lasted. They changed the formula recently, which amounted to watering down the scent and active ingredient in an apparent over the top effort to increase profits by using less ingredient. No change in price in an already pricey product line.\n\nBottom line is that it's a bad product now. 5 stars to 1 star, and I'm not kidding. I literally went from using only this, to none of it. Don't buy this product!", "I have been using this product for about half a year now and I really like it. I used the other Old Spice body washes that don't have the \"Hydrating formula\" and found them to not lather as well and also make you seem to use a lot more as compared to this one which seems to only need a little bit and you are set. I also think the sent is good as it not to overpowering. So if you have used just the gel body wash I suggest giving it a try, especially this sent, the Double Impact version is good but I prefer this one better.", "To put it plainly: This stuff is awful. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it fulfils the function of soap and gets you clean, but for the money and time a bar of Dial will do the same thing without the nasty smell.\n\nI am a fan of the Old Spice liquid soap line, and I've always liked the way Old Spice smells. So when I saw this stuff I bought it on a whim. Big mistake.\n\nFirst of all the color is mildly nauseating, not that that really matters. Irish spring is about the same color complete with the swirls of lighter green. But then there's the texture.. The nozzle of the Livewire is extra wide, presumably to allow this semi-gelatinous gunk to gloop out of the bottle at a reasonable rate instead of having to noisily squirt out of the usual small hole. The texture of this stuff bears a worrying resemblance to that of congealed chicken grease.\n\nThen there is the smell. When I opened the bottle in the store and sniffed it didn't smell too bad. Rather unusual, maybe, but I thought I'd give it a go. I quickly discovered that taking a hurried whiff in the store and actually rubbing the stuff on your body are two completely different things. The odd, somewhat refreshing scent that I experienced in the supermarket turned to a sour, nasal-coating odor that actually left a metallic taste in my mouth just from smelling it.\n\nHow can that be? That a liquid soap that's not designed to interact with the digestive system in any way should leave a metallic taste in your mouth?!\n\nIn conclusion, if anyone has bothered to read this far, there are plenty of Red Zone washes available, or barring that, plenty of other brands out there that aren't nearly as nasty as this stuff. If this is the only thing available then it's a good time to have a serious heart-to-heart with the store manager about other career options that don't involve the use their personal tastes.\n\nNot worth it."],

    "description": "Details & Care What it is: An instant miracle mascara tested on the red carpet, that extends and holds your lashes out, giving you the longest, most luscious lashes of your life. Who it's for: Anyone who wants lashes with extraordinary volume. What it does: Giving your lashes 13 times the volume with just three coats, this mascara is formulated with a unique blend of waxes and ingredients to ensure that it's hydrating and full of bounce, nourishing, strengthening, protecting and stimulating the growth of your lashes, all while feeling weightless. It's designed with an innovative, multi-bristle flutter brush that features bristles of differing sizes to ensure that even the most fine and short lashes are caught and coated for a separated, elongated look. How to use: There are many ways to wear one mascara, and the way you apply it can dramatically change the shape and size of your eye. Charlotte recommends powdering the eye area before applying mascara, and sticking to application on your top lashes because of its its creamy, oil-based formula. Charlotte has three different methods for application to create a bigger, more intense or elongated eye. - The Wing Lash: a technique that elongates the eye for a seductive, hypnotic look. Hold the brush diagonally across your lashes and pull the brush up and out. - The Doll Lash: a technique that opens up your eye for an innocent, youthful look. Hold the brush vertically and pull up through the lashes from root to tip. - The False Lash: a technique that intensifies and frames the eye for a glamorous red-carpet look. Hold the brush horizontally across the lashes and pull up in a zigzag action, nestling the brush first in the lashline.",

These are perfect for keeping the hair from going down the sink (which has clogged up our sink in the past). My husband is a very messy shaver and he hates shaving. So he lets his beard grow to the point that he needs to use the trimmer to knock off the majority of the hair before he can actually shave with a razor. You can imagine the mess! He tries to clean it up but honestly doesn't do a very good job (sorry honey but you know it's true). These covers cut down on so much, if not all, of that mess. The only drawback is that if your husband is super messy and just sends hair flying everywhere then there may still be a little mess. Fortunately it will be greatly minimized though. The sheets are 36x24 according to the package so they are an adequate size depending on the size of your sink. I also agree with other reviewers that these could have multiple uses from crafts to spreading one under your child's plate to minimize the mess on your table or high chair, which would be especially good for children learning to feed themselves. The included comb is nice and seems to be good quality.\n\nNow on to the price. I personally think $25 for a box of disposable plastic sink covers and a comb is ridiculous. I guess it is up to you to determine how much you want to minimize your messes and cleaning and if the expense is worth it to you, but honestly had I not gotten this at a discounted rate for review I would have never paid this for them. You could use a trash bag for pennies. What I don't understand is that you can buy a box of just the sink covers for $12.50 (used to be 9.99) but add in the comb and it goes to $25 (oh and when I ordered these for review the price was $35). That is just nuts to me. So needless to say I would not personally buy these again at this price. The product is great, which is why it is getting 5 stars, but it's not $25 great.\n\n*I received this item at a free or reduced rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

    "reviewText": ["Ah, the days of boyhood. Looking up at your dad or grandpa, admiring the skill with which he wields the razor. The hot water steaming upwards, carrying with it the scent of his shaving cream. Brings back memories, huh?\n\nWell, for over a year now I'd been using Gillette Foamy Regular to great satisfaction. It smells spicy--think Christmas--and lubricates the blade well. The scent went nicely with my Every Man Jack aftershave cooling gel (you can really get the Christmas scents going).\n\nBut I always had one gripe about the Regular formula Gillette Foam: the burn.\n\nI haven't figured out why, but it burned my skin. I have eczema, so shaving burns anyways, but phew. Still, I kept using it because the price was right and I don't like the gels. My last can of the regular was running out, so I was going to pick up a new can.\n\nI got to the store and this Sensitive formulation foam was sitting right next to it. I figure \"what the heck, I'll give it a shot.\"\n\nWell, I just got back from using it and holy tacos, Batman. That smell punched me right in the face; it was the smell that used to waft up from the sink when my dad would shave and I'd look on, wishing I had some manly stubble to demolish with a miniature axe.\n\nSo, indeed, I love it, but I'm biased.\n\nImpartially I can say that it goes on smoother and seems thicker overall than the regular formulation, and instead of burning my skin it cooled it. It lubricated well, though that manly stubble I always dreamed of is, in reality, about half as dense as I'd wished it to be.\n\nAll in all I can definitely recommend this.\n\nOne thought though. The smell, no matter how fantastic it is to me, is fairly faint but lingers, and it could be judged by some younger people as smelling too much like something their grandpa would wear. I still love it though.", "I just used a razor for the first time today along with this cream, and it keeps my face well hydrated for a very comfortable shave! The hair just comes right off! And the smell is awesome, almost like an aftershave smell! Didn't get any cuts or nicks or anything!", "A terrific buy.  You are likely NOT going to beat this price. Wal-Mart price is $12.21 for 3. Same 11 oz. container just without the large round top cap, only difference. Buy it this way and stock up. You can find room.  Recommended. And, it's an excellent shaving foam."],

The 30 inch long scrubber is long enough to ensure you can reach all those hard to reach places. It's one of the longest scrubbers you can purchase, which makes it perfect for men and women of all sizes. We want to make sure you can exfoliate and clean exactly what you want to clean, so we made the scrubber an extra thick 4 inches wide. Some of the cheap thinner ones will just roll up on themselves, twist, or fold in half. Why waste your hard earned money on something so inferior? Customers told us they wanted a scrubber just tough enough on one side, but soft and gentle on the other. We delivered with this scrubber one side of the scrubber feels like a loofah, and will exfoliate your skin nicely. Next, turn the scrubber over and polish your skin with the soft, gentle cotton side. Your back and skin will thank you for it the straps are made out of strong, long lasting rope handles. They have just enough give in it to ensure you can move the scrubber in any direction you need it, but is strong enough to handle all the scrubbing you can give it the Mineral Springs Luxuries loofah scrubber is great for personal use, or great to give as a gift pair the scrubber up with your favorite body soap, and you have the perfect spa gift to give to your friends, co-workers and loved ones.",

I had spoke with Jill at Emeritus at length about nasty sell tactics of online retailers and learned how tough small businesses have it on Amazon. It was agreed that I would evaluate the product and provide a fair and unbiased review of it. The hope is that my fellow customers would see my ranking and know that this review comes from an honest place. I hope that my track record (96% positive from the community :) ) will help offset some of the shady \"fake\" reviews that have haunted Jill and her company.\n\nService: Jill was responsive and straight forward. A rarity among my interactions with companies, Jill actually takes care of and grows her products. This isn't some pump out warehouse. Jill cares. Selling plants on Amazon has to be tough. Dealing with the \"my plant didn't look like the picture\" has to come about often and the mishandling of product during shipping can ruin a customers experience. I was pleased with the level of care and detail that Jill put forth.\n\nQuality: I received the Aloe plants over 2 months ago. They were packaged perfectly and wrapped just as you see in the pictures. The aloe is thick and full. Much larger than any other Aloe plant that i've owned. My girlfriends plant looks like a spec compared to these! I typically wait 2-3 weeks to write a review but live things need time. I wanted to make sure that the product \"lived\" up to expectations. The plants have stood the test of time. I was initially disappointed because two of the spines had issues, one was dying and the other was on the way out. The impact to the overall look of the plant was minimal and at this price I would be very happy with my purchase.\n\nSummary: Worth the price for thick well maintained Aloe plants. Natural issues with live products but overall a great experience.\n\nI decided to take a star away because of the dead spine. The other one is actually recovering quite well. The dead spine is in no way a deal breaker on the product."],

It only took me several days for my face to get used to it.  Blade razors, like Mach 3, give better shaves but they usually leave cuts on my face so this has been great.  The shaving time is actually shortened for me because I just do it during the shower, and so easy to clean. Nevertheless, 8 hours are too long for charging- pricier 7775X model only takes 1 hour. Also the plastic body looks very fragile.  Like others said, Nivea cartridges can run out fast. But I found a remedy- Nivea \"after shave balm\" 3.3 oz. at $4.79 in a local CVS pharmacy gives you the same quality as little five Nivea 0.4 oz. cartridges(total 2 oz.) at $5 do. I have a sensitive skin and Nivea sensitive \"after shave balm\" has been great.  I hope this helps."],

    "description": "With or without aromatherapy, gently weighted eye pillows can help relax the muscles behind and around the eyes and nose which can then trigger a relaxation response in the muscles in the cheeks, jaw, chin and neck. Since eye pillows block out light and relax muscles, they are ideal for a variety of therapeutic uses including, nap therapy, massage therapy, meditation, resting fatigued eyes, and, of course, savasana. These pillows can be safely chilled in the freezer in a sealed plastic bag or warmed in the microwave for approximately 20 seconds. The gentle weight of the flax seed allows the pillow to smoothly and comfortably adapt to individual facial contours. Different essential oils may provide relief from stress, anxiety, or headaches. Dimensions: Approximately 9 in x 3.5 in. Weight: Approx. 8 oz. Newly designed with removable outer cover for easy washing and inner mesh pillow to allow for easy re-scenting.

We received full size samples of both the Cherry Blast and Citrus Sport natural deodorants to try. We kept the Cherry Blast, and gave the Citrus Sports to our friends' 10 year old son to try.\nThe girls were so excited to review this natural kids deodorant. Coco and I opened the package while waiting for Lulu to get off the school bus. When she got off the school bus, they decided that they needed to take a shower right then and there, but we had company over, a 4 year old family friend, and had someplace to be in about 35 minutes. So they took a shower that evening. I think this was the first time EVER that they were excited to take a shower over a bath. They felt the shower would get them to the deodorant more quickly, I think. Now it is part of their after-bath routine. And I'm okay with that. With all-natural ingredients and a pleasant, fruity smell, I don't mind that they're always reaching for their new, natural deodorant.\nI reviewed feedback about the deodorant we gave away.  The 10 year old is relatively active, and his parents' really appreciated that it was natural.  He had been using deodorant before, and this one is working out well.\nThis product is a good fit if you're nervous about the chemically-laden products currently on the market, especially when you're using them on your children. While my daughters are only 4 and 6, we've been using as many natural products as we can (afford), ever since my youngest was diagnosed with a congenital adrenal deficiency shortly after birth. And although many people wouldn't think that 4 and 6 year olds need deodorant, when they're playing outside, in 100 degree weather (like today, in Columbia, SC), they are STINKY when they come inside. This deodorant helps with that. I also like to rub it across the bottom of their feet, and it helps their feet not to stink and sweat so much.\nYou'll have to decide for yourself when it is appropriate for your children to begin using deodorant, but when you do make that decision, reach for an all natural deodorant like Junior Varsity Naturals Kids Deodorant It currently retails for $6.99. Plus, they offer free shipping for US and Canadian customers."],

I love it  smells great and leaves your hair clean clean and very shinny  great product", "I have shampooed my hair about once every 2-3 months for over 10 years. I hate that \"squeeky-clean\" sound, and the tangling of my thick curly hair. This bar gets my (and my thicker haired daughter's) scalp and hair clean without drying it out. I even used it on my Virgin Indian Remy weave hair, and it didn't require conditioning, afterward.", "The first time I used this shampoo bar, I really didn't like the way it made my hair feel, tangled and kind of greasy.  But I had heard your hair or scalp has to adjust to shampoo bars so I kept using it.  After a few days I have really come to love how soft and manageable my hair has become. It also leaves your body nice and moisturized and so smooth too!  I also use the Tasmania conditioner bar just on the ends of my hair and it compliments this bar very nicely.  No tangles, soft and bouncy hair!  I am a blonde, which has been damaged by highlighting my more brassy dirty blonde natural hair color and it was really in bad condition.  Most shampoos will further dry out my hair, this bar doesn't at all and it does have a pleasant clean scent, nothing overpowering just a hint of a fruity or citrus scent.  It looks like I barely used it so it will last a long time, just be sure to keep it out of the shower when not using it or it may melt (especially the conditioning bar).  Overall I love both products and would order again.  Still waiting on my Lush order to see if they are worth the heftier price tag.  Would recommend for damaged and dry partially wavy hair for a luxurious soft, bouncy and manageable mane!"],

This eco-friendly all natural shampoo bar is not only perfect for regular daily use but also for those suffering with a dry scalp or with unruly and frizzy hair. The shampoo bar delivers an enriched and enhanced natural color and feel to hair of all types and colors. Don't use our Shampoo Bars just once or twice - Give them a chance! Most people report positive results after just 1-2 washings. However, at least 3-4 washings are needed to remove previous products from the hair. If you using synthetic hair styling products such as gel or wax, it's important to use an Apple Cider Vinegar Rinse for best results. Use 3 tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar in a quart of water and rinse your hair after shampooing and conditioning to remove the chemical build up in your hair. This process will restore the PH balances to your scalp for super healthy hair.\nTry our Apple Silk Clarifying Hair Rinse - an alternative to our best selling Apple Cider Conditioning Rinse, to remove the silicone plasticizers in commercial conditioners and the last residues of shampoo soap.

I finally decided that my original T870 had to be defective, so I followed Norelco's instructions and took it to a local dealer, who ordered me a replacement. What a difference!! My original one must have been some early production model that should never have made it to market. The replacement has a strong housing which doesn't deform. The motor is powerful, the noise is a lot lower (it sounds normal) and the performance is that of a powerful trimmer that is very capable. It trims very well, and the vacuum function works well, also. THIS IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE. I can now very confidently and strongly recommend this trimmer. If you buy this trimmer, and find that its performance is the way I described it in my original review, TAKE IT BACK. Get a replacement. You'll then have an excellent trimmer with a useful vacuum feature.", "This trimmer works very well and the battery stays charged much longer than my previous trimmer. I use it once a week or more, no problems.", "I've used this thing for years and it works really well.  My only complaint (which I have about a number of rechargeable devices) is that it should run on AC power when it's plugged in instead of having to wait for the battery to charge after it's died.  I'm guessing that might drive the price up a bit, but with that feature you'd have the best of the cordless and corded capabilities."],

I guess the water like consistency makes it not optimal.", "Background: Zits used to be a thing of the past for me. However, after my cycle returned after having my second child they decided they missed me and wanted to visit frequently, especially that special week once a month. Typically pimples show up around my mouth or on my temples. I had only been using normal facial cleansers and no acne specific product until now.\n\nExperience: I have been using the Zit Zapper for about 3 weeks. When I'm not on my cycle, my pimples are fairly small. The second week of using this was the week I experience the really bad acne issues. I had 3 huge pimples pop up overnight. It was time to really see what this stuff can do. During that week I usually applied the Zapper three times a day, but a couple days I only did it twice. Those first 3 pimples were gone at least two, if not three, days sooner than they normally would be. They seemed slightly less red than normal, but not as much as I would have liked. A few days after getting the initial pimples I had 2 more big ones pop up. The Zapper also helped clear them faster than normal. I had no negative reaction to the Zapper. There's a slight tingling for less than a minute when I apply it, but it doesn't cause any irritation, redness, or dryness.\n\nIt's a small tube, but the Zapper is a liquid (slightly viscous, but definitely not a gel) so you don't need much at all. In the tube it has a slight scent that smells nothing like pineapple. One you put the liquid on your finger it has absolutely no scent at all. It comes packaged very nicely in a pink nylon\/mesh pouch with strips of pink paper folded like an accordion. It's a perfect presentation for a gift. My only advise is to be very careful when you first try to get the liquid out of the tube. Be very gentle and go slow otherwise, like me, you'll get liquid everywhere and waste at least 10 applications worth.\n\nI received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.", "I've tried just about everything to get clear skin... and I'm still looking. Though, this True Girl Pineapple Blast Zip Zapper is doing a pretty good job so far. I have combination skin, and a great mixture of white heads, black heads, and them big 'ol cystic pimples (I've been battling this thing since the 7th grade -- I'm about 8 years out of college now). I've use Pro-Activ and J&J products mainly, and this product is doing a good job of reducing my bigger zits (not so much blackheads). If I catch them early, they go away faster. I'd say it takes about 3 days, and about 2-3x reapplying a day to maximize the effects. I'm hoping that this will be a longer term solution for me (as most products wain in their effectiveness after about 3 months for me -- I guess my acne builds up a tolerance -- and hence the cautious rating of 4 stars and not five). I look forward to bringing this on vacation with me (I always seem to get breakouts during vacation!). Overall, I am very happy that I was able to review this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion. My clear(er) skin and experiences are my own."],

    "reviewText": ["I do not know about the medicinal uses for this product. I use camphor for protecting metal tools against rust.\nIn the old-days, we could go to the corner drugstore and buy camphor blocks, about 1-inch square and 1\/4 inch thick. You just slice open the wrapper, peel it back and toss in in your tool box or drawers. The camphor emits a gas that prevent oxygen from attacking metal surfaces of tools like planes, chisels, squares etc.\n\nThe problem these days is finding the stuff. Modern pharmacies do not typically stock it any more. After searching everywhere, I found this product from this company. The shipping was a trifle slow compared to other Amazon orders I have placed, but it came before the estimated delivery date.\n\nThe product is good and reasonably priced for my application. If you want to protect your tools inexpensively, save all your desiccant packages from electronic equipment and other items you may have purchased, because they are all re-useable indefinitely. You need only dry them out in an oven for reuse. Placing small quantities of camphor inside tool drawers helps prevent the electro-chemical reaction that causes rust. Camphor works well for this purpose, especially if you use enough and the tool containers are sealed reasonably well. Although this product is ten times the cost of the old blocks we used to buy, it is still one tenth the cost of commercial corrosion inhibitors.\n\nIf you want to try this method for protecting your tools economically, save used plastic and glass jars, such as those you have for jams, jelly, peanut-butter etc. Clean them thoroughly. Place a few tablespoons of granulated camphor in the jar and cover with cheese cloth, held in place by a rubber band. For very small drawers, you can skip the jar and just wrap camphor granules in any lightweight porous cloth. Secure with a rubber band.\n\nThis method works for your fine silverware or jewelry too! Camphor has salubrious results for any metal that can rust or tarnish. This product, judging by the feel, texture and smell, is the real deal. Beware of other products that have only a small percentage of active camphor. They are not as effective. It takes far more to do the job, so it is no bargain. Real camphor is so potent that it only takes an ounce or two to protect a drawer full of tools and it lasts about a year.\n\nIf any of you find an economical source for the little camphor blocks, post a comment near this review because the blocks are more convenient to use. But until I find a better source, this is the best I have found. This bag has enough quality product to protect tools in several woodworking shops for five years or more! That's still cheap insurance against rust.", "I was thrilled to finally find solid product!  I used to buy blocks at the pharmacy but most no longer stock them.

    "description": "5-Blade Shaving Surface Technology with 5 PowerGlide Blades spaced closer together to help reduce pressure with more comfort and less irritation than MACH 3\n\n8 years of shaving innovation and numerous patents make Gillette Fusion Phantom Power better than MACH3. Gillette Fusion Power is an advanced shaving system with an advanced design that provides optimal performance when using either side of the razor. On the front of the cartridge, Gillette Fusion Power features 5 PowerGlide Blades spaced closer together to form a shaving surface technology. This design distributes the shaving force across the blades to help reduce pressure, with more comfort and less irritation than MACH3. In addition to more comfort, the 5-Blade Shaving Surface engages more hair more times with successive cutting action, resulting in a closer shave. That's a great shave. But Gillette now has a razor that turns shaving into gliding! It's called the Gillette Fusion ProGlide.\nWhat makes Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power better than Gillette Fusion Power? What makes Fusion ProGlide better than Gillette Fusion is technological innovation. The razor has been reengineered and redesigned to create Gillette's Most Comfortable Shave.\nGillette Fusion ProGlide shares the same core technology as Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power: thinner, finer shaving blades*, a low resistance coating and the redesigned Precision Trimmer Blade. In addition to this:\nTogether, these technologies combine to create Gillette's Most Comfortable Shave.\nHow does the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle compare with the Gillette Fusion Power handle?  The Fusion ProGlide Power now has ergonomic side grips for better handling.\nWhat is the microchip and how does it work? A battery-powered razor delivers an optimal shave when the voltage and frequency remain consistent shave after shave. Over the lifetime of the battery, the voltage can weaken, reducing frequency and therefore performance. The microchip maintains constant voltage and frequency over the lifetime of the battery, delivering consistent product performance every time you shave.\nHow does the Low-Battery Indicator Light work? When a battery reaches a certain level, the oscillation frequency declines and the system is no longer capable of delivering the optimal shave. The microchip inside Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power senses when the battery is approaching this level. When this happens, the Low-Battery Indicator Light begins to flash, signaling that it's time to change the AAA battery.\nWhat is the Automatic Shut-Off feature? The Automatic Shut-Off feature turns the razor off after roughly 8 minutes of continuous operation. This feature protects the battery if the razor is accidentally activated, especially when traveling.\nHow does movement of the razor give men a better shave? With battery-powered razors, Gillette opened a new chapter in wet shaving. The addition of oscillation to Gillette wet shaving systems delivers soothing micropulses with comfort so incredible; you'll barely feel the blades. Fusion ProGlide Power is Gillette's most comfortable shave.\nFor best results, should the power be turned on or off when using the Precision Trimmer Blade?  The Precision Trimmer Blade can be used with the power turned on or off. Preference varies from person to person. Using the Precision Trimmer Blade with or without power is an individual choice.\nWhat type of battery does Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power use? How long does it last? Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power utilizes a AAA battery. With the Low-Battery Indicator Light, Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power will let you know when it's time to change the battery. Assuming average shaving, the battery should last approximately 36 months.\nIs it safe to shave with Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power in the shower?  Yes. Gillette Fusion Power is watertight and totally safe to use in wet environments.\nCan I get electrocuted if Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power is submerged in water? No. Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power is safe to use in water.\nHow long will the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge last? How long a razor cartridge lasts varies from person to person, as it is dependent on many variables such as beard toughness and thickness, beard preparation, shaving habits, and skin sensitivity. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power's reformulated INDICATOR lubricating strip will provide you with a visual cue  it fades to white  when optimal shave conditions have been reduced. When this happens, you may want to change your cartridge for a more comfortable shave.\nWhat are thinner, finer blades* and how will they improve my shave?  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor has 5 blades spaced closer together, forming an advanced shaving surface. The razor blades are thinner* than those of Fusionenabling the blades to cut effortlessly through the hair with less tug and pull.\nHow was the Precision Trimmer redesigned?  The blade was improved and anti-clogging rinse slots were added.\nWhat is the Streamlined Comfort Guard with channels? What are the benefits of the Streamlined Comfort Guard? Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power features a Streamlined Comfort Guard. The soft, flexible material surrounds the microfins, creating an outer edge that wraps around the sides of the cartridge and channels that clear away excess shave prep. This Streamlined Comfort Guard follows the contours of your face to help the shaving surface of the razor comfortably shave close.\nHave there been any enhancements to the lubrication strip?  Yes. It now contains more lubricants and a touch of mineral oil.\nWill the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge fit any other razors on the market?  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge features a razor blade that fits on any Gillette Fusion, Fusion ProGlide or Fusion ProGlide Power handle.\nIs it better to use hot, cold, or warm water to shave? Warm water is best for hydrating beard hair. Soaking in warm water softens hair and causes it to expand, making it 70% easier to cut.\nWhat is the best way to avoid razor burn?  If the skin is not properly prepared before shaving or if the blade on your razor is dull, you are more likely to end up with razor burn. Make sure to hydrate hair in warm water for up to three minutes and apply plenty of shave gel. Also, be sure to change the blade on your razor at the first sign of dullness or discomfort.\nIs it okay to let my girlfriend or wife borrow my mens razor? For both hygiene and performance, it's not a good idea to share your razor with your partner. Women have a much larger area to shave and you may find that after only a few shaves, your blade has dulled considerably; increasing the likelihood of nicks and cuts. Tell her to try a razor specifically designed for the way a woman shaves, such as Gillette Venus Embrace.\nDoes shaving make your hair grow back thicker? Scientists at Gillette have conducted extensive testing on the effects shaving has on both male and female hair growth, texture and color. This testing has proven that shaving does not affect hair growth, color or texture. Shaving does, however, alter the tip shape of the regrown hair, which may initially change the way hair feels as it grows back. But if hair is left to re-grow completely, it will return to its former state.\nIn what direction should I shave to achieve the best shave? Men's facial hair tends to grow in different directions. Start by shaving with light, gentle strokes with the grain. Then, if necessary, go against the grain for an even closer shave.\nWhat is the difference between disposable and refillable razors? The entire razor is discarded when you are through with a disposable razor. With a refillable razor, only the blade cartridge is replaced. Refillable razors like Gillette Fusion ProGlide and Gillette Fusion incorporate more advanced blade technology and ergonomics vs. most disposables for great control and a close comfortable shave.\nWhat is the difference between a single, double, triple and 5-blade razor? Which is best? Gillette's research has demonstrated that single blade technology, which has been applied since 1901, is demonstrably inferior to twin blade shaving systems such as Sensor Excel, and even more so to 5-blade systems such as Gillette Fusion ProGlide. But the number of blades alone does not ensure a superior shave. The 5-blade shaving surface of Fusion ProGlide Manual and Fusion ProGlide Power features progressive blade alignment, an advanced blade coating process and a flexible comfort guard which collectively provide Gillette's best shave.\nHow do I avoid nicks and cuts, particularly above my upper lip? The area above the upper lip is tricky for many men. To help avoid nicks and cuts, always leave it for last. Apply plenty of shave gel and allow this area to soak up as much lather as possible. When shaving, don't apply too much pressure. Gillette Fusion ProGlide's Precision Trimmer is really useful when shaving under the nose.\n\n\n",

The combination of cool pink and warm golden undertone makes this shade the perfect blush!", "It has been several years since I used up my last Ramy B1*&@#-Slap blush, and with Spring coming on full force (it's in the 80's down here in the tropics, I am not making this up) I found myself craving another B-Slap blush for the Spring and Summer months ahead. So I ordered it, thinking that I already know what the color is like so I didn't need to worry about seeing it in person first before buying it. So when the compact arrived, I was surprised to find that the color had changed a bit. Instead of being a neutral\/natural pink, it definitely has become a light, cool-tone pink. Now, this really isn't a problem because it's just the right shade and tone that will work very well on my cool-toned complexion, but it ISN'T the B-Slap blush I remember from 6 or 8 years ago. And I feel a little disappointed. I really liked how that almost-but-not-quite warm\/neutral pink looked on my complexion. I will still wear it; it's a lovely pink, but it isn't \"the old\" B-Slap that I remember. Warm-toned girls who used to like the original blush color will have to look elsewhere for this color because this incarnation will look a little too blue-pink on you.", "RAMY Blush in 2 Shades A big disappointment.  I have medium skin color and the shade I chose was the Alive.  It was not at all visable, actually seemed to match my skin tone.  I gave it to my fair skinned daughter, and it did not not even show up on her.  Since thrown away, it was just a waste of money."],

I've heard of it from blog and I've purchased it like a year ago. Now I'm getting my 3rd jar. Guys check out the ingredients of this cream! it 100% natural and raw! I've never bought anything like this before! I don't have any cystic acne I have much less of regular white had acne, but I've changed my make up as well. I don't use liquid foundation any more and I don't use any chemically active ingredients on my face. I'm trying to eat natural food. \"Trying\"  doesn't mean happens all the time. Anyways this cream is the best!! I will suggest it to everyone!!", "Oh, wow. I thought I was the only one who had discovered this conceptually great skin food in my East Village neighborhood, at the Live Live boutique. I wandered in, captivated by Bee Yummy's minimalistic ingredient listing: honey, honey cappings, bee pollen, st. johns wort oil, royal jelly, water, and balsam needles.\n\nAfter trying a sample---- amazed by the non-sticky residual, super quick absorption, and raw, organic goodness--- i snapped up a whole selection of Live Live products: Bee Yummy, the Honey Face Mask (very pricey), and the Love Butter (100% pure coconut oil). Out of all 3 products, the Bee Yummy and Love Butter are the best.\n\nBee Yummy quickly sinks into skin like a serum. It is best for oily skins or young skins who don't need extra hydration. Unfortunately, it doesn't do much to truly hydrate as it has the texture of a very light water-based, \"teen-ish\" moisturizer. It will NOT keep you moisturized in the dead of winter--you'll still need something more occlusive. But no doubt it's good for your skin --so, i use it as a underserum before applying my heavy duty moisturizer and after my vitamin C potions as a \"middle layer\".\n\nIf you are looking for a basic, oil-free type of hydrator, why use one laden with chemicals when you can use this? If you are looking for anti-aging superpowers, forget it. This won't help, but it won't hurt. I have not had any miraculous \"magic\" healing with this product and don't expect it to. It is not a magic potion.  Take Bee Yummy for what it is: a organic, natural alternative to a basic light moisturizer."],

It will still work wonders. I also like another reviewer's idea; he writes that you could apply this to your hands and then cover them with gloves to keep the cream on.\n\nAs of this time the price is just about a buck higher than a local discount pharmacy, so if the price stays this way I will stock up on this product through Amazon.

And then I went out into the humid night...Success! My hair actually retained curl without looking frizzy or mushroomy.

Thus, eliminating the need for constant recharges.  Although pricey, it is money well spent.  I've gotten the best shave from this model, no irritation and my face was smooth as a babys skin.", "Norelco's latest line of razors is definately an improvement in functionality as well as appearance.  The closeness of the shave is unbeatable even with a razor.  This being the \"James Bond\" edition, it is also very cool looking.  The dark blue gloss finish is paired with stainless steel trim for a high-tech appearance.  The razor also comes with a high quality leather travel bag.\nWhether it is worth [money] over the base model is a good question.  One must also factor in the fact that the base model doesn't even have a low batter indicator!  The Spectra 8894x does have such a feature, as well as a clean razor and replace razor heads indicator.  There is no choice in my opinion, this is definately the Spectra model to own.", "I used a Braun shaver for about 10 years, but found that I had to shave at least once a week with a blade razor to prevent ingrown hairs. I have been using the Norelco 8894XL for about a week and so far no problems or temptation to shave with a blade. The shave is reasonably close, but compares with how my beard would be about 2-3 hours after shaving with a blade razor. The thing is cleaned with water - very convenient compared to my old Braun.\n...I am not sure about the \"James Bond\" part - so far no babes or fast cars and my martinis tend to be stirred.\nAdded after a couple of months use: I have now had the razor for a couple of months. Still excellent. The ability to wash the razor out with water is a huge plus when it comes to cleaning. A single charge lasts for over an hour's worth of shaving - this is about 40-50 shaves for me.

A 2-stage cutting action with lift and cut technology uses slots to cut long hairs and holes to shave stubble smooth, while the full-width pop-up trimmer handles the detail work. The integrated LED display shows shaving minutes remaining, plus cleaning and head replacement indicators. A 1-hour full-charge gives you 100 shaving minutes, while the 2-minute power-charge provides a 3-minute shave. When you're done, simply rinse clean. Includes deluxe leather pouch, stand, recharging power cord, cleaning brush and travel pouch. Automatic worldwide voltage adjustment. No. 8894XL. Imported. 5-1\/2L\".\nLicensed to shave closely and painlessly, this cord\/cordless  electric shaver is designated Norelco's James Bond model not only  because it's high-tech but also because its heads can be adjusted to  suit the sensitivity of 00-anyone's skin. The shaver has a  comfort-control dial that varies the spring and pressure of the three  floating heads through nine settings. Roger Moore might opt for a  gentle setting, while Sean Connery surely would choose a firmer  setting--and novices to grizzled veterans can please their faces as  well. For this model, Norelco has also improved the lift and cut,  below-skin shaving technology of its two-stage cutting system, which  provides slots for longer hairs and holes for stubble while the  floating heads are adjusting individually to facial contours. A  full-width trimmer pops up for neat work on sideburns and mustaches.\nMore tech-chic comes in the form of a polymer LED display that tells  how many minutes of shaving time remain when the shaver is operating  cordless on its lithium-ion battery. The LED display also warns when  the heads need cleaning (all it takes is a rinsing under running water)  or replacing (replacement heads available separately). An audible alarm  sounds when the shaver requires recharging on its storage stand. A  six-minute quick charge is good for a single shave, and a one-hour full  charge provides 100 minutes of cordless shaving. The shaver fits the  hand beautifully and goes on the road stylishly in its leather travel  pouch, while automatically adjusting to worldwide voltage variances. It  carries a 60-day, full-satisfaction, money-back guarantee and a  two-year warranty against defects. --Fred Brack",

Kent brushes (as they are now more commonly known) was founded in 1777 by William Kent in the reign of George iii. Kent holds a pre-eminent place in the history of brush making, with an unbroken record of excellence in the quality of its production which has been recognized by the granting of royal warrants for nine reigns. The Kent family continued to run the company for six generations until 1932 when the last of the three Kent brothers passed away. This is when mar Eric lb. cozy, owner of cozy brushes ltd, entered into an association with g. B Kent & sons. A new chapter was then opened in Kent's long history, and since that time the company has been under the creative and dynamic direction of the cozy family. Today, mar Alan hall cozy, grandson to Eric cozy is the managing director and chairman, with his wife, son and one of his three daughters working for the business. The company headquarters moved from London to their existing factory in Aspley, Hertfordshire on the 6th February 1984, and remains there to this day.

I've been hearing a lot of Youtubers and bloggers talk about them but I have so many brushes I didn't really feel the need to rush out and get these. I own a variety of brushes but most of them are MAC, Sigma and a couple Artis brushes. I love my sigma brushes but It's a hassle to order them because they take forever to ship and I worried about getting them on Amazon for risk of getting a fake (it seemed from the reviews that it was an issue).\n\nI'm currently working on my first beauty blog and I've had the pleasure of trying all kinds of makeup brands and brushes (paid for myself) and I figured if anything I should at least give one of these babies a try. It didn't disappoint AT ALL. It's so much softer than any of my Sigma brushes and the synthetic hairs don't get pokey - definitely a plus in the delicate eye area. It was a bit bigger than I thought but it does a great job of picking up product and applying it precisely where I need. I like the point and use it primarily for precise crease work (like cut crease looks) and in the outer V.\n\nI purchased this brush with my own money and I can totally recommend these brushes for anyone looking for a good alternative to MAC or Sigma. I'll definitely get more of these.", "Great brush.", "It's great for doing a cut crease. It's pointed enough for precise color application, and fluffy enough to blend it out at the same time. I use it for my halo smokey eyes as well. Perfect for getting into that tricky inner corner. Other brushes I have are either too big and throw product against the bridge of my nose, or they're too small and I have to go back repeatedly to build up color. It's also good for smoking out the lower lash line."],

    "description": "How to Use   Apply nail polish on your nails and wait until completely dry. We recommend using fast dry top coat over nail polish or bare nails to create a flat surface which helps the product stick better. Make sure nail is dry and free of oily residues before applying product.   Lightly push tape\/stencils to the nail using a finger, especially paying attention to the areas near skin, cuticles, and the tips of long nails. You can always cut nail tape to size if they are too long and cut stencils to help them form better to the tip, sides and curvature of the nail. Try peeling stencils from different directions if you have trouble with smaller pieces not remaining on the backing paper. Find your direction and peel fast, holding stencil close the backing sheet. When small pieces remain within a stencil, flip and stick\/peel the stencil to the back of the paper to remove all stuck pieces.  Apply fresh or thinned, not thick or gloopy, nail polish across the tape\/stencil. Shimmer and metallic nail polishes work better than cremes. We recommend applying nail polish with a sponge lightly pushing it to your nail, similar to ombre design, this prevents any polish bleeding under the stencil giving cleaner lines. Remove extra nail polish from your skin and cuticles by using a flat brush dipped in acetone or nail polish remover.  Remove tape\/stencils immediately after applying nail polish using your fingers, tweezers or nippers while the polish is still wet. For better results pull the tape following its edges and stencils following the pattern.   Wait until your design has completely dried before applying top coat. Use fresh or thinned top coat, hold your brush parallel to your nail and try not to touch a nail with the brush, only the top coat drop should touch the nail to prevent smearing.  ",

I noticed the battery wasn't holding a charge anymore so I bought a replacement set for less than ten dollars and did the simple repair myself as per instructions from the battery vendors website. I am due for a set of replacement cutter heads and it will be good as new. The motor runs a well as it did on the first day and that was about ten years ago. When this one finally kicks the bucket and is beyond repair I will not hesitate in buying another Norelco. It is built to last with the normal maintenance of cleaning and lubrication and if you are a bit handy it will last far longer. This model has an adjustment for closeness of cut for those with sensitive skin and a basic flip out trimmer on the back. The head assembly flips open and is also easily removable for cleaning as are each of the cutter heads for a more comprehensive cleaning job. As per the instructions always keep the individual cutters and foil heads paired when cleaning and reassembling as they wear together.", "GREAT shaver. Well worth the price! Updated\/upgraded from a 10 year old similar model and this one is superb. Used by both husband and wife, the Spectra shaves faces, neck area and legs equally well. Lots of adjustment for closeness. Fits very nicely in the hand. It cleans very easily with the top piece flipping up to the side instead of coming apart separately. Nice feature. Haven't cleaned it under running water yet, our humidity is very high and don't want to worry about it drying completely between uses. QUICK charging and it has a great holder\/stand. Would certainly encourage others to buy this product.", "I bought an electric shaver because I'm lazy.  I used a Mach 3 for about 4 years and then upgraded to Mach 3 Turbo blades.  I got a really close shave (I go with and against the grain) and with the exception of the right and left parts of my chin, there were no signs that facial hair even existed there.  But this would take me forever, and the last thing I want to do when I wake up is shave.  So I decided to buy an electric shaver.  I've had the shaver for about two weeks now.  I was not very content with my first coulple shaves, but things improved over time.\n\nPros\n\n- Gets very close.  The left and right sides of my chin are still difficult to shave, but I get much closer than I used to.\n\n- Takes half the time to shave.\n\n- There is a little collection compartmant that captures the hair so I can shave in my room while my roommates are taking a shower.\n\n- It comes with 9 settings.\n\nCons\n\n- Its difficult to shave around the neck.  I tend to cut myself a little whenever I try.\n\n- The cap was annoying at first becasue it is difficult to tell which side attaches to the front.  I ended up drawing an arrow.\n\n- Cleaing and drying it is kind of a pain.\n\n- Near the end of the battery life, the shaver kind of dies down.\n\nOverall, I am satisfied with my purchase.  The instruction manuel recommends changing blades after a year (they cost about 20 dollars I think).  I think its worth it."],

    "description": "For centuries, the luxury of French-milled soaps has remained the gold standard of excellence. Each time you begin to lather a French made soap, you enter a time and place where quality and craftsmanship have stood still. Traditional French soap is triple-milled to produce a completely uniform and smooth soap, without impurities, thus lasting longer. Every bar of Pre de Provence soap is not only carefully made today by the dedicated soapmakers in Provence following their proud traditions, but quad-milled to be smoother and have a richer lather to create our luxurious feel. Using all pure, natural ingredients enriched with shea butter, you can feel the difference of our unique quad-milling process. Aromatic fragrances transport you to a moment of calmness, vitality, dreamin or well-being. This 150 Gram bar is a great value, the fragrance maintains until the soap is all used up. The soap creates a rich, creamy lather and rinses clean, leaving skin soft and hydrated.",

It was done traditionally by pouring wine into a decanter which has a large surface to allow wine to be exposed to air, but it takes 30 minutes or longer, now with this instant wine decanter, wine aeration is done in seconds!\nAdjustable Aeration Speed! Just turn the stainless steel band to pick an aeration speed, choose from 0 to 6! 0 speed means no air coming from the center air tube, the air hole is closed, you can tell by seeing no bubbles at the bottom of the aerator where the wine coming out as you pour the wine. From 1 to 6 speed, the higher the speed, the bigger opening of the air hole from the center of the air tube, the more air mixes with the wine, the more bubbles you can see. One neat device for all different kinds of wine. It is great for red wine, but white wine can also benefit from some aeration! Try it to see the difference it makes! Buy one for red wine, and one for white wine! Experiment with different speed, and find your favorite speed!\nMulti-Stage Aeration! The first stage occurs when the wine hit the little umbrella on the top and splash to mix with air, then the wine coming through the tiny draining holes in the middle, wine is exposed to more air, then coming down to the mixing chamber to mix with air from the air tube and forming lots of bubbles at the exit tube! Because of these multiple stages of aeration, the wine is aerated in seconds as it goes through the different stages of dancing with air!\nBeautiful and Sleek Design!

Great product~!", "My first impression with this product, I was impressed with the size of the bottle. You really do get a lot to work with and it will last you a really long time. As some of the other reviewers stated it does have a milk like look and texture to it, a bit too runny for my tastes but it is great for doing wrinkles  and makes a wonderful adhesive. I enjoyed the fact it did not have an overpowering smell like a lot of the liquid latex on the market. I first did a skin test just to make sure there was no reaction to it which should always be done when using a new product. I started by covering a patch of skin and letting the latex dry a bit and lightly pinched the skin together to create wrinkles. As I said it is great for wrinkles the skin kept together and the latex had just enough give to not be uncomfortable. Next I decided to try out making a wound  by using some tissue paper dipped in the latex, this is where the consistency gave me a bit of an issue, I would recommend using a hair dryer on a low setting if you decide to \"sculpt\" with the latex, once dry it was easily painted and came out looking nice. I would say in my experience with the latex thus far my favorite thing to use it for would be as an adhesive for foam latex appliances and masks. I would recommend buying this if you have a haunted attraction or a large group project going on because there is plenty to go around at a decent price.  2013", "I'm a newbie to the world of liquid latex, so I was uber nervous about using it. With help from special effects friends, I had no issues with using this product.\nThe first thing I noticed is that the price of the product is great for the amount you receive (and it arrived faster than I thought it would). Also, this is a great product for beginners and super easy to use. I was very impressed with the drying time after application and further impressed when I had no issues with the removal process. Created wicked wounds and can't wait to make more. Gonna need another bottle to prepare for Halloween!  - 2008"],

I'm super excited to be wearing this wig to two conventions in the spring.", "The shipping was waaaaay faster than expected, since I wasn't supposed to receive this item until February 12th. I really love how soft the wig is. It's not too shiny and has a great feel to it. The inner cap that the fibers were sewn onto is very round and seems small, but makes it so much easier to move around in without worrying about it falling off ((I literally played volleyball with my friends in this wig and it didn't even come out of place)). The black fibers are uneven\/different lengths which I love because it makes it more realistic. The wig however needs lots of styling due to the lengths of the actual blonde fibers being uneven, but that is expected from any wig and I am okay with that. The black and blonde fibers are very very easy to blend and actually gives the effect of grown out roots. The only real complaint I have about the wig is that the front area is still blonde without any black to cover it, so I would suggest coloring them. Since the picture was honest about this fact, I still love the wig because I expected it to be that way. Its a very great wig. I love it! Definitely recommend the wig to anyone that is okay with the extra work.", "This wig came earlier than expected and was in great condition when I got it.

No, the Braun Series 5 Clean &amp; Renew System is the latest model from the Braun Clean &amp; Renew System line and cannot be used with previous models.\nHow often do I need to exchange the Clean &amp; Renew System refill cartridge? It is recommended that you change your Clean &amp; Renew refill cartridge at least once every two months or when the Clean &amp; Renew system notifies you that the cleaning solution is ready to be changed. This will vary depending on how often the system is in use.\nDo you have any recommendations for how to shave with an electric foil shaver? We recommend that you shave before taking a shower. After a few days without shaving (for example, the first shave after the weekend), you should trim your stubble before you shave. Stretch the skin and shave against the direction of beard growth. Hold the shaver at a right angle (90&#176;) to your skin. Maintain even pressure to achieve the most thorough and comfortable shave from Braun.\nHow often do I need to change the shaver head? We recommend replacing all cutter parts every 18 months. In order maintain optimal performance, we included a replacement part indicator in the display to ensure that you'll know when to exchange the cutter parts.\nDoes the battery have a memory effect, as can occur with cell phones or laptops? No, the Braun Series 5 electric shavers for men use a Li-Ion battery that has no memory effect. You can recharge it whenever you want, and it has a low self-discharge rate (vs. NiMh batteries). Li-Ion batteries are the most powerful and longest-lasting batteries available for Braun electric shavers.",

By pulling down on the base, the brush can then be retracted and the lid put back on with ease.  The only problem I had was when the bottom unscrewed and half the powder dumped out.

If you're simply looking for coverage and a clear matte finish, this is not the right product for you.\n\nGo with the SPF 30 that reads transparent, not translucent.", "My friends and family jokingly call me the Sunscreen Queen. I have used sunscreen in multiple forms from so many lines I have lost count, and I tend to mix sunscreens to get the maximum benefit. When I saw this product I was curious-althought I have used stick, liquid, gel, lotion and spray, I hadn't tried a pure powder sunscreen. After using this sunscreen for a few months, I have to say I am impressed.\n\nInitially I applied the sunscreen mid-day after my morning sunscreen had worn off. Although this is for the most part a clear powder-when applied damp or wet skin-it takes on a darker orange\/tan color that is less than flattering. However, I started to apply this in the morning after my normal skincare routine and became very impressed with the results. The powder absorbed residual oil, my skin did not tan or burn, and it was much faster and easier to apply than my normal sunscreen. What made me really happy was that I was able to apply it around my area without my eyes watering-something that rarely happens with sunscreen. I also apply it to my throat and chest area and I have not burned while using it\n\nThere have been a few downsides. My skin is not accustom to powder, and because this is such a fine powder it has clogged my pores and I have broken out because of it. Additionally, because this is an \"all in one\" device, I have not been able to clean the brush without having it mix with product.

But the bristles don't come out or bend as much as other brands we have tried. The tongue scraper is useless, buy a seperate tongue scraper if your little one has bad breath, otherwise just skip it. The subscribe and save price is a pretty good price. We will be buying more soon. Also don't forget that they need their little teeth flossed just as much as adults do, buy a pack of flossers or even better floss their teeth yourself if they will let you.

    "reviewText": ["First and foremost, these things deliver on their promise to make your teeth \"noticeably whiter\" in two weeks.  I'm not going to complain about that.\n\nHowever, I have noticed the following things:\n\n-These things are insanely hard to get into your mouth the first few times.  It's a shame there's no \"spare\" strips included, because you're likely to waste a couple.  The lower strips especially are prone to getting crumpled up and ruined while trying to stick the damn thing to your teeth.\n\n-The gel tastes terrible.  I recommend brushing your teeth shortly after you remove them.\n\n-You can't really talk, drink, eat or do anything with your mouth while they're on your teeth- even swallowing is difficult at first.\n\n-The packaging does not stress that you need to use them TWICE A DAY.  I made the mistake of using them only once a day until I luckily saw the note on the package.\n\nBut, like I said, my teeth look quite a bit better, although this isn't a substitute for brushing.", "I was surprised to see results after just one use. You have to use the 56 pack 2x a day and can do the upper\/lower set of teeth together or at different times. The strips are coated with a clear gel that is whitening the teeth. The strip for the bottom set of teeth is very small and only covers about 5-6 teeth, but the upper strip offers better coverage. My teeth were white already, so now they are really white. I gave a few strips to my mom who has coffee stained teeth and they worked for her after only 3-4 uses. Good results. Pleased with the product.", "Crest Whitestrips is a wonderful product!  I recommend them to anyone and everyone.  I saw my teeth getting whiter after just two days.  Then my neighbor made a comment about how pretty my teeth were! Out of nowhere! That's when I really knew that it was working!  I experienced some tooth sensitivity a couple of times, but nothing major.  And it goes away quickly.  Definitely worth the price--invest in yourself and your self-esteem!"],
    "description": "Crest Whitestrips are the easy way to get whiter teeth in just 2 weeks. These thin, flexible strips conform to the shape of your teeth, and are coated with a gel that contains hydrogen peroxide, the same enamel-safe ingredient used by dentists for teeth whitening. Wear Crest Whitestrips just 30 minutes, twice a day. Simply place the gel side of each strip against your front teeth and fold the rest of the strip behind your teeth to keep it in place. In two weeks you will have noticeably whiter teeth. New clinical results prove whiter teeth for 12 months. Each box contains 56 strips: 28 for upper teeth, 28 for lower teeth. The secret to a whiter smile is in the strip - Guaranteed.",

Additional Product Features\n\n\n\nX\n*First four blades vs. Fusion.**vs. Fusion&#174; Manual.\n\nHow long will the Gillette Mach3 Power cartridge last?How long a razor cartridge lasts varies from person to person, as it is dependent on many variables such as beard toughness and thickness, beard preparation, shaving habits, and skin sensitivity. The Gillette Mach3 Power Cartridges have an lubricating strip which will provide you with a visual cue &#8212; it fades to white &#8212; when shave conditions have been reduced. When this happens, you may want to consider changing the blade on your razor.\nWill the Gillette Mach3 Power cartridge fit any other razors on the market?The Gillette Mach3 Power cartridge features a razor blade that fits on any Gillette Mach3 Power, Mach3 Turbo, or Mach3 handle. All Mach cartridges can fit on all Mach handles.\nIs it better to use hot, cold, or warm water to shave?Warm water is best for hydrating beard hair. Soaking in warm water softens hair and causes it to expand, making it 70% easier to cut.\nWhat is the best way to avoid razor burn?If the skin is not properly prepared before shaving or if the blade on your razor is dull, you are more likely to end up with razor burn. Make sure to hydrate hair in warm water for up to three minutes and apply plenty of shave gel. Also, consider changing the blade on your razor at the first sign of dullness or discomfort.\nIs it okay to let my girlfriend or wife borrow my men&#8217;s razor?For both hygiene and performance, it's not a good idea to share your razor with your partner. Women have a much larger area to shave and you may find that after only a few shaves, your blade has dulled considerably; increasing the likelihood of nicks and cuts. Tell her to try a razor specifically designed for the way a woman shaves, such as Gillette Venus&#174; Embrace&#174;.\nDoes shaving make your hair grow back thicker?Scientists at Gillette have conducted extensive testing on the effects shaving has on both male and female hair growth, texture, and color. This testing has proven that shaving does not affect hair growth, color, or texture. Shaving does, however, alter the tip shape of the regrown hair, which may initially change the way hair feels as it grows back. But if hair is left to regrow completely, it will return to its former state.\nIn what direction should I shave to achieve Gillette&#8217;s best shave?Men&#8217;s facial hair tends to grow in different directions. Start by shaving with light, gentle strokes with the grain. Then, if necessary, go against the grain for a close shave.\nWhat is the difference between disposable and refillable razors?The entire razor is discarded when you are through with a disposable razor. With a refillable razor, only the blade cartridge is replaced. Refillable razors like Gillette Fusion ProGlide and Gillette Fusion incorporate more advanced blade technology and ergonomics vs. most disposables for great control and a close comfortable shave.\nWhat are the differences between single, double, triple and 5-blade razors? Which is best?Gillette's research has demonstrated that single blade technology, which has been applied since 1901, is demonstrably inferior to twin blade shaving systems such as Sensor Excel&#174;, and even more so to 5-blade systems such as Gillette Fusion ProGlide. But the number of blades alone does not ensure a superior shave. The 5-blade shaving surface of Fusion ProGlide Manual and Fusion ProGlide Power features progressive blade alignment, an advanced blade coating process and a flexible comfort guard, which collectively provide Gillette's most comfortable shave.\nHow do I avoid nicks and cuts, particularly above my upper lip?The area above the upper lip is tricky for many men. To help avoid nicks and cuts, always leave it for last. Apply plenty of shave gel and allow this area to soak up as much lather as possible. When shaving, don't apply too much pressure.",

The color that I received was a pale sheer pink, which is exactly what I wear.  I had my nail salon remove my gel polish and then I applied Essie's Gel Couture.  The bottle design in unique and in my opinion, easier to hold on to, less chance of it slipping out of my hand.  The polish went on smoothly and evenly, I applied two coats of the color and one of the top coat.  I only waited about a minute between coats.  The top coat provided amazing shine and wasn't too thick or too thin and went on smoothly as well.  It took approximately 5 minutes for my nails to dry which I was happy about because unfortunately I am a very impatient person.  The polish lasted two and half weeks, no chips at all!  Color stayed fresh, I did not have to reapply my top coat to keep the shine going.

The biggest one (the one that is an inch and a half) killed the smallest one when it molted. The carnage was unbelievable.  I don't know if they sent me the wrong species, but these things are nothing like the description, neither in appearance nor behavior.  The biggest one is a monster, twice the size of the description, aggressive and now a killer.  Will not be purchasing from Susie's Gifts again.\n~~\nEven though the seller states OneStopAquatics, the $38.00 price was only offered by a different seller, Susie's Gifts, at the time of my purchase.  I hesitated with Susie's Gifts because of the 50% positive rating. My overall experience with Susie's Gifts was ok.\n\nMy initial concerns were that the package sat for 3 days in California before it shipped based on the tracking.  I received the package (Milwaukee, WI) in 6 days.  I was concerned because all the other Aquatic stores I've shopped with delivered in 2 days with a $10.00 shipping cost.  I contacted Susie's Gifts on the third day after seeing it was just sitting in CA. They assured me that having years of experience shipping live animals around the world the crayfish would be fine for over 4 weeks in the package.  Susie's Gifts charges $5.00 for shipping.\n\nThe package arrived with a signature required so I had to go to the post office after work.  The package was not marked with any indicator of Live Animal or Fragile as other sellers do, so again I was concerned.  I immediately opened the package when I got home.  All was well, they ate well and were active. Even though Susie's Gifts was not as professional in their shipping containers or arrival times as other shippers the 3 crayfish were healthy, eating and active.\n\nThey were brown and a lot bigger than I expected. The largest was 1.5 inches long, second over an 1 inch and the third just under an inch.  Based on the description of .25 to .5 inches long I initially wanted to put them in my Cherry Red Shrimp tank, but due to the very large size I put them into another aquarium with my gentle fish.  The largest was bold and did not hide.  The other two hid for about an hour and they all three were exploring the aquarium. The two largest got into a violent shaking fight that lasted a few seconds but they walked unharmed. As of this morning (12 hours later) they seem fine, active and slightly more blue in color.", "very sweet and cute. Tiny and active. Healthy little guy but entirely brown.

    "description": "The \"Dwarf Blue\" Cambarellus Diminutus seems to show the best coloration in soft water with lower PH settings.

Do I really have to bother with two forms of whitening?\nTooth stains can fall in two general categories, extrinsic stains and intrinsic stains. Extrinsic stains are stains at the tooth&#8217;s surface. Intrinsic stains are stains beneath the tooth&#8217;s surface. Although most whitening toothpastes are a great way to remove stains on a daily basis, most only work on the surface to provide an extrinsic benefit to your smile.\nWhitestrips, on the other hand, work both on surface stains as well as beneath the surface of the enamel. Going beyond where most whitening toothpastes leave off, Whitestrips whiten beneath the enamel surface for overall whiter teeth. Because of the extrinsic and intrinsic value of Whitestrips, you&#8217;ll see results that are noticeable.\n \nI have teeth sensitive to whitening. Can using Whitestrips make it worse?\nSome people may temporarily experience a small amount of tooth sensitivity when using whitening products, which is completely normal, but know that Whitestrips are absolutely enamel safe.\n \nIn your opinion, are Crest 3D White Whitestrips really the best whitening option out there?\nA lot of my patients ask advice on which brand to use for a whiter, brighter smile and I always tell them Crest 3D White.\n ",

    "reviewText": ["Amazing.\n\nPros:\nIt works. By this, I mean that it gets a lot of whiteheads out. Basically, you wash your nose. Pat it dry. Put on step 1. Wait 10 minutes. Take it off. Get disgusted at the whiteheads literally oozing out of your pores in little puddles of white. Scrape it off with an extractor. Be even more disgusted as the extractor forces out even more whiteheads and blackheads (You may have to work at it a little, but don't overdo it!). Follow the rest of the instructions.\n\nDoes it actually improve the appearance of my nose? Actually...yes. It's not magical. I still have large pores. There's just been a comparably noticeable change after four uses. (I still have six more to go!)\n\nThere's a generous amount of product. Every sheet is soaked in product, and I actually pour a little bit of the extra onto my nose strip whenever I think it's getting dry.\n\nThe product for Step 3 smells like roses and feels great. It really soothes your nose.\n\nThe instructions are in English on the Step 2 (blue) packets. Be sure to read everything. One step in the instructions is poorly worded.\n\nThe packaging is very easy on the eyes. Easy to open. Feels like quality. The English isn't perfect, but only a grammar nazi would catch the mistakes.\n\nCons:\n\nThe third time I used it, it peeled my skin. Yeah, scary. It didn't happen in the moment of using it (thank goodness!). I noticed my nose peeling the next morning while applying foundation. Now, this could be due to a number of things: I went too ham on it with the extractor; I tried a separate, new pore serum that my skin wasn't used to; or I just left the Skinmiso strips on for too long (should've followed instructions!).\n\nThe fourth time I used it, it made my nose breakout just a little. I had a couple of red dots form as well as a small, red bump that wanted to be acne but couldn't really pull it off. Again, this may be due to the fact that I pressed a little too hard with my extractor.\n\nIt stings just a little. Both Step 1 and Step 2 can be a little too tingling. It's bearable for me, but it'll vary based on pain tolerance and how much you worked at the extraction during Step 1.\n\nOverall, really great product.

Additional Product Features\n\n\n\nX\n*First four blades vs. Fusion.**vs. Fusion&#174; Manual.\n\nHow long will the Gillette Mach3 Power cartridge last?How long a razor cartridge lasts varies from person to person, as it is dependent on many variables such as beard toughness and thickness, beard preparation, shaving habits, and skin sensitivity. The Gillette Mach3 Power Cartridges have an lubricating strip which will provide you with a visual cue &#8212; it fades to white &#8212; when shave conditions have been reduced. When this happens, you may want to consider changing the blade on your razor.\nWill the Gillette Mach3 Power cartridge fit any other razors on the market?The Gillette Mach3 Power cartridge features a razor blade that fits on any Gillette Mach3 Power, Mach3 Turbo, or Mach3 handle. All Mach cartridges can fit on all Mach handles.\nIs it better to use hot, cold, or warm water to shave?Warm water is best for hydrating beard hair. Soaking in warm water softens hair and causes it to expand, making it 70% easier to cut.\nWhat is the best way to avoid razor burn?If the skin is not properly prepared before shaving or if the blade on your razor is dull, you are more likely to end up with razor burn. Make sure to hydrate hair in warm water for up to three minutes and apply plenty of shave gel. Also, consider changing the blade on your razor at the first sign of dullness or discomfort.\nIs it okay to let my girlfriend or wife borrow my men&#8217;s razor?For both hygiene and performance, it's not a good idea to share your razor with your partner. Women have a much larger area to shave and you may find that after only a few shaves, your blade has dulled considerably; increasing the likelihood of nicks and cuts. Tell her to try a razor specifically designed for the way a woman shaves, such as Gillette Venus&#174; Embrace&#174;.\nDoes shaving make your hair grow back thicker?Scientists at Gillette have conducted extensive testing on the effects shaving has on both male and female hair growth, texture, and color. This testing has proven that shaving does not affect hair growth, color, or texture. Shaving does, however, alter the tip shape of the regrown hair, which may initially change the way hair feels as it grows back. But if hair is left to regrow completely, it will return to its former state.\nIn what direction should I shave to achieve Gillette&#8217;s best shave?Men&#8217;s facial hair tends to grow in different directions. Start by shaving with light, gentle strokes with the grain. Then, if necessary, go against the grain for a close shave.\nWhat is the difference between disposable and refillable razors?The entire razor is discarded when you are through with a disposable razor. With a refillable razor, only the blade cartridge is replaced. Refillable razors like Gillette Fusion ProGlide and Gillette Fusion incorporate more advanced blade technology and ergonomics vs. most disposables for great control and a close comfortable shave.\nWhat are the differences between single, double, triple and 5-blade razors? Which is best?Gillette's research has demonstrated that single blade technology, which has been applied since 1901, is demonstrably inferior to twin blade shaving systems such as Sensor Excel&#174;, and even more so to 5-blade systems such as Gillette Fusion ProGlide. But the number of blades alone does not ensure a superior shave. The 5-blade shaving surface of Fusion ProGlide Manual and Fusion ProGlide Power features progressive blade alignment, an advanced blade coating process and a flexible comfort guard, which collectively provide Gillette's most comfortable shave.\nHow do I avoid nicks and cuts, particularly above my upper lip?The area above the upper lip is tricky for many men. To help avoid nicks and cuts, always leave it for last. Apply plenty of shave gel and allow this area to soak up as much lather as possible. When shaving, don't apply too much pressure.",

Anyway after a long day at work it turned out to be  a very soothing treatment, left my feet feeling super smooth, soft and minty... I would reccomend these and will be purchasing more as soon.", "I received my exfoliating foot masks in the mail, and naturally I wanted to try them right away. I started by grabbing a few things I'd need for the application and then I washed my feet. I flipped on the TV and went to the couch, and laid out a sheet of paper on the ground so that I wouldn't get any of the mask on the floor. Then, I grabbed a fan brush (you can also just use your hands) and applied a generous amount of the mask to the bottom of my feet. Next, I wrapped each of my feet in a plastic bag to avoid making a mess during the walk from the couch to the bathroom to rinse everything off.\n\nI left the mask on until it was completely dry, which took about 20-25 minutes. While it was on, it had a very cooling, minty feel to it. There was no discomfort, quite the opposite actually. It was relaxing to just lay around for a little bit and reminded me of being at the spa. The smell is also minty, which adds to the experience. It was easy to rinse off, and my feet felt softer and rejuvenated after using it. My feel generally sweat more when I'm wearing high heels because the material does not allow for proper ventilation, which leads to my feet slipping forward in the shoes, or the shoes accidentally fall off. With this mask, this problem was greatly reduced.\n\nI'm happy with the mask and will continue to use it. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. I hope this was helpful to anyone who is considering trying it!", "just received these foot masks today, and i was so excited  to try them out! i usually tend to have dry patches on my heels and on the palms of my feet due to enclosed shoes, putting the mask on and just relaxing letting it do its job was awesome.  no more scrubbing with pummice stone to make an attempt at removing dry skin. loved the end result washed my feet (super soft now btw) and rubbed a bit of moisturizer and i feel amazing!"],
    "description": "Green Cambrica Clay Treatment for feet prone to perspiration. This wonderful product is based on Cambrian Green Clay - a source of minerals with therapeutic properties. Gently exfoliates rough skin and stimulate regeneration. Cooper and zinc with scientifically proven antibacterial effect, prevent from feet perspiration and soothe irritations and abrasions. The content of mint and green tea is a natural green treatment for feet and guarantees fresh and velvety smoothness. In response to the increasing number of people affected by allergies and various skin conditions, the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries are rediscovering secrets of healing methods known in the old cultures and civilizations. In their search for the most effective skin products skin care experts turn to natural resources. Undoubtedly, Cambrian Green Clay is a gift from Nature, which, thanks to its properties, is exceptionally valuable for skin care. Numerous laboratory tests show that the composition of this volcanic mineral is very well-balanced in terms of the effect it has on the human system. Artificial food processing, pollution (especially acid rain, fertilization by nitrogen compounds, etc.) impoverish the environment thus the living organisms in macro-and microelements. Green Cambrian Clay perfectly complements these deficiencies. Healing properties of the clay were well known and appreciated in an ancient Egypt. The Egyptians used clay in the process of mummification, because they knew its purifying and preservative properties. The famous Arabic physician - Avicenna describes in detail the properties of clay and its applications in therapy in his work \"The Natural History\". Greek doctor - Dioscordies thought that clay had extreme revitalising properties. Famous German healers of the last century: Kneipp, Just, Felke, were successfully using clay as a natural remedy. Clay is one of the most popular in Europe therapeutic agents used in the treatment of the broad spectrum of health.",

An amazing and graceful way to start the day. Why use a tongue cleanser? Our tongues are almost a third of the surface area of our mouth. They are a rich surface of papillae that has been likened to a deep-pile carpet. That makes them an excellent trap for decaying food debris and bacteria. Medical evidence shows that this environment can create bad breath, plaque and dental decay, as well as reduce taste sensitivity. Toothbrushes and mouthwashes simply cannot remove bacteria as effectively or safely as tongue cleansers. Using a tongue cleaner will: - reduce bad breath - reduce plaque formation - reduce tooth decay - refresh the palate, enabling taste buds to function more effectively Why Amano? The Italian-crafted Amano Tongue Cleanser has been designed to give a superior tongue cleansing performance. The head is made of 18\/10 Austenitic Steel  a high-grade chromium and nickel alloy. Because of the precise design and weight, there is NO GAG affect! And unlike a plastic tongue cleanser, which needs to be regularly replaced, an Amano Tongue Cleanser will last for years to come.",

I didn't want regular drug store variety glycerin because wanted the glycerin to be a food grade glycerin, and this product is just that.  Food grade glycerin is important to me for several reasons; one reason is if I should put a small amount in lip balms, I want to be able to lick my lips and not ingest toxic petroleum based chemicals. I can also use it for dry mouth; it has a light sweet taste, and after I brush my teeth, my mouth dries out so this really helps with that.  Some people use it as a sweetener, I haven't tried that yet, but it is sweet, I don't see why that wouldn't work.  I find the price to be reasonable through Amazon, better than the natural food store price.

    "description": "Gillette Fusion Manual Razor; Phenom; 1 Razor. 5 Blade Shaving Surface&#8482; Technology. Has 5 blades spaced closer together to help reduce pressure - with less irritation and more comfort. 1 precision Trimmer Blade built into the back of the cartridge. Perfect for tricky places like sideburns, under the nose and around facial hair.\n  \nGillette&reg; Fusion&reg; Phenom&#153; is an advanced shaving system with a design that provides outstanding performance when using either side of the razor. On the front of the cartridge, Gillette Fusion Manual features blades spaced closer together to form a shaving surface technology. This design distributes the shaving force across the blades to help reduce pressure, with more comfort and less irritation than MACH3&reg;. That's a great shave. But Gillette now has a razor that turns shaving into gliding! It's called the Gillette&reg; Fusion&reg; ProGlide&reg;.\nWhat makes Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power better than Gillette Fusion Power? What makes Fusion ProGlide better than Gillette Fusion is technological innovation. The razor has been reengineered and redesigned to create Gillette's Most Comfortable Shave.&dagger;\nGillette Fusion ProGlide shares the same core technology as Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power: thinner, finer shaving blades*, a low resistance coating and the redesigned Precision Trimmer Blade. In addition to this:\nTogether, these technologies combine to create Gillette's Most Comfortable Shave.\nHow does the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power handle compare with the Gillette Fusion Power handle?  The Fusion ProGlide Power now has ergonomic side grips for better handling.\nWhat is the microchip and how does it work? A battery-powered razor delivers an optimal shave when the voltage and frequency remain consistent shave after shave. Over the lifetime of the battery, the voltage can weaken, reducing frequency and therefore performance. The microchip maintains constant voltage and frequency over the lifetime of the battery, delivering consistent product performance every time you shave.\nHow does the Low-Battery Indicator Light work? When a battery reaches a certain level, the oscillation frequency declines and the system is no longer capable of delivering the optimal shave. The microchip inside Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power senses when the battery is approaching this level. When this happens, the Low-Battery Indicator Light begins to flash, signaling that it's time to change the AAA battery.\nWhat is the Automatic Shut-Off feature? The Automatic Shut-Off feature turns the razor off after roughly 8 minutes of continuous operation. This feature protects the battery if the razor is accidentally activated, especially when traveling.\nHow does movement of the razor give men a better shave? With battery-powered razors, Gillette opened a new chapter in wet shaving. The addition of oscillation to Gillette wet shaving systems delivers soothing micropulses with comfort so incredible; you'll barely feel the blades. Fusion ProGlide Power is Gillette's most comfortable shave.\nFor best results, should the power be turned on or off when using the Precision Trimmer Blade?  The Precision Trimmer Blade can be used with the power turned on or off. Preference varies from person to person. Using the Precision Trimmer Blade with or without power is an individual choice.\nWhat type of battery does Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power use? How long does it last? Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power utilizes a AAA battery. With the Low-Battery Indicator Light, Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power will let you know when it's time to change the battery. Assuming average shaving, the battery should last approximately 3&ndash;6 months.\nIs it safe to shave with Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power in the shower?  Yes. Gillette Fusion Power is watertight and totally safe to use in wet environments.\nCan I get electrocuted if Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power is submerged in water? No. Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power is safe to use in water.\nHow long will the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge last? How long a razor cartridge lasts varies from person to person, as it is dependent on many variables such as beard toughness and thickness, beard preparation, shaving habits, and skin sensitivity. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power's reformulated INDICATOR&reg; lubricating strip will provide you with a visual cue &mdash; it fades to white &mdash; when optimal shave conditions have been reduced. When this happens, you may want to change your cartridge for a more comfortable shave.\nWhat are thinner, finer blades* and how will they improve my shave?  Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power razor has 5 blades spaced closer together, forming an advanced shaving surface. The razor blades are thinner* than those of Fusion&ndash;enabling the blades to cut effortlessly through the hair with less tug and pull.\nHow was the Precision Trimmer redesigned?  The blade was improved and anti-clogging rinse slots were added.\nWhat is the Streamlined Comfort Guard with channels? What are the benefits of the Streamlined Comfort Guard? Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power features a Streamlined Comfort Guard. The soft, flexible material surrounds the microfins, creating an outer edge that wraps around the sides of the cartridge and channels that clear away excess shave prep. This Streamlined Comfort Guard follows the contours of your face to help the shaving surface of the razor comfortably shave close.\nHave there been any enhancements to the lubrication strip?  Yes. It now contains more lubricants and a touch of mineral oil.\nWill the Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge fit any other razors on the market?  The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power cartridge features a razor blade that fits on any Gillette Fusion, Fusion ProGlide or Fusion ProGlide Power handle.\nIs it better to use hot, cold, or warm water to shave? Warm water is best for hydrating beard hair. Soaking in warm water softens hair and causes it to expand, making it 70% easier to cut.\nWhat is the best way to avoid razor burn?  If the skin is not properly prepared before shaving or if the blade on your razor is dull, you are more likely to end up with razor burn. Make sure to hydrate hair in warm water for up to three minutes and apply plenty of shave gel. Also, be sure to change the blade on your razor at the first sign of dullness or discomfort.\nIs it okay to let my girlfriend or wife borrow my men&rsquo;s razor? For both hygiene and performance, it's not a good idea to share your razor with your partner. Women have a much larger area to shave and you may find that after only a few shaves, your blade has dulled considerably; increasing the likelihood of nicks and cuts. Tell her to try a razor specifically designed for the way a woman shaves, such as Gillette Venus&reg; Embrace&reg;.\nDoes shaving make your hair grow back thicker? Scientists at Gillette have conducted extensive testing on the effects shaving has on both male and female hair growth, texture and color. This testing has proven that shaving does not affect hair growth, color or texture. Shaving does, however, alter the tip shape of the regrown hair, which may initially change the way hair feels as it grows back. But if hair is left to re-grow completely, it will return to its former state.\nIn what direction should I shave to achieve the best shave? Men's facial hair tends to grow in different directions. Start by shaving with light, gentle strokes with the grain. Then, if necessary, go against the grain for an even closer shave.\nWhat is the difference between disposable and refillable razors? The entire razor is discarded when you are through with a disposable razor. With a refillable razor, only the blade cartridge is replaced. Refillable razors like Gillette Fusion ProGlide and Gillette Fusion incorporate more advanced blade technology and ergonomics vs. most disposables for great control and a close comfortable shave.\nWhat is the difference between a single, double, triple and 5-blade razor? Which is best? Gillette's research has demonstrated that single blade technology, which has been applied since 1901, is demonstrably inferior to twin blade shaving systems such as Sensor Excel&reg;, and even more so to 5-blade systems such as Gillette Fusion ProGlide. But the number of blades alone does not ensure a superior shave. The 5-blade shaving surface of Fusion ProGlide Manual and Fusion ProGlide Power features progressive blade alignment, an advanced blade coating process and a flexible comfort guard which collectively provide Gillette's best shave.\nHow do I avoid nicks and cuts, particularly above my upper lip? The area above the upper lip is tricky for many men. To help avoid nicks and cuts, always leave it for last. Apply plenty of shave gel and allow this area to soak up as much lather as possible. When shaving, don't apply too much pressure. Gillette Fusion ProGlide's Precision Trimmer is really useful when shaving under the nose.",

Using a curling iron or straightener on low settings might work, won't be long-lasting and runs the risk of melting the wig. However, you can style it with near-boiling water. Get a styrofoam wig head, curlers, a stand, whatever. If you want to straighten, let the wig hang straight and dump hot water on it. If you want to curl or style differently, get it into shape using curlers, pins, etc., and then add the water. Allow it to air dry. It works really well and will keep the new style.   Providing natural and gorgeous wigs is what we kamo seeks to. Full and thickness make it can pass as real hair. As to the cap size, there are hooks for you to adjust the fit and fix it in place. It is very easy to wear. If it gets tangled when you wore for several time, do not worry about this. Just use some wig spray and comb it slightly,and it will be the same one as you received at the first time.

    "description": "How to Use   Apply nail polish on your nails and wait until completely dry. We recommend using fast dry top coat over nail polish or bare nails to create a flat surface which helps the product stick better. Make sure nail is dry and free of oily residues before applying product.   Lightly push tape\/stencils to the nail using a finger, especially paying attention to the areas near skin, cuticles, and the tips of long nails. You can always cut nail tape to size if they are too long and cut stencils to help them form better to the tip, sides and curvature of the nail. Try peeling stencils from different directions if you have trouble with smaller pieces not remaining on the backing paper. Find your direction and peel fast, holding stencil close the backing sheet. When small pieces remain within a stencil, flip and stick\/peel the stencil to the back of the paper to remove all stuck pieces.  Apply fresh or thinned, not thick or gloopy, nail polish across the tape\/stencil. Shimmer and metallic nail polishes work better than cremes. We recommend applying nail polish with a sponge lightly pushing it to your nail, similar to ombre design, this prevents any polish bleeding under the stencil giving cleaner lines. Remove extra nail polish from your skin and cuticles by using a flat brush dipped in acetone or nail polish remover.  Remove tape\/stencils immediately after applying nail polish using your fingers, tweezers or nippers while the polish is still wet. For better results pull the tape following its edges and stencils following the pattern.   Wait until your design has completely dried before applying top coat. Use fresh or thinned top coat, hold your brush parallel to your nail and try not to touch a nail with the brush, only the top coat drop should touch the nail to prevent smearing.  ",

    "description": "Bali Soap's traditional collection is comprised of 3 individual exciting formulations. Uniquely textured with organic botanicals from the Indonesian archipelago. Each of these soaps has a bubbly lather and rinses off clean without residue.\nEach bar has its own unique feel that ranges from smooth to lightly exfoliating and one or two bars with some extra grit to really scrub your skin clean. Our base oils provide a healthy lather that cleans and leaves your skin feeling moisturized. We employ the cold process soap making method and do not add heat or chemicals to the soaps we mix by hand. This process produces a bar full of natural glycerin, which is a by-product of the soap making process. Unlike most soap on the market today, we do not remove this glycerin from our soap because it is a humectant, which helps attract moisture to the skin and can be gentle enough for even the driest and most sensitive of skin.\nBali Soaps pack of three ultra-nourishing moisturizing bars thoroughly cleanses, gently exfoliates, combats pathogens, soothes itching, eliminates flaking and moisturizes fragile, damaged, dry skin. May also help to relieve people suffering with skin conditions such as: dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis and rosacea.\nEach bar of soap is individually wrapped. These soaps are great for placing in your guest bathroom, inside a mason jar, or as gifts for every occasion.\nIf you are looking for a great natural soap bar that provides real skin conditioning, moisturizing, and is gentle enough to use all over then search no further.\nNo Parabens\nNo Phthalates\nNo Sulphates \n Suitable for all skin types including the most sensitive",

I think the spray works well, it helps give my hair shine and it feels soft without making it look greasy. I don't like the way it smells, almost too chemically, but it seems to do a good job. I use it 2-3 times a week and will continue doing so after I shower.", "I have long, baby-fine hair with natural waves.

When hair is properly conditioned, it not only looks better and feels better, it holds its style better and longer. I used Marvel 10 Effects with a blow dryer and also with just letting my hair dry naturally--great results either way. Well-conditioned hair also requires less styling products to create and keep a style in place. Your hair will look healthier and be so much more touchable with less hairspray and other styling products \"gooping\" it up. I found the scent to be somewhat strong, but it diminished after a while. This is a non-greasy, effective conditioner which did not leave my fine hair flat.\n\nReview Product Gratis Second Glance Beauty", "I have been on the hunt for a product to eliminate static from my hair, and this is the only one that has worked!

    "reviewText": ["I've used this Norelco 9199XL for a month now and ......no surprises. It's still the best electric shaver you can buy. Even the less expensive Norelco shavers are the best no \"frills\" no nonsense and quietest electric shavers on the market.\nPersonally I enjoy some of the \"frills\". The usage by the minute and time remaining before charging, the adjustable \"sensitive skin\" shaving level makes a noticeable difference for me, the triple \"floating head\" system not only provides a smoother shave (smooth as a blade in my opinion) but a faster shave as well, and of course the time saving and efficient \"rinse clean\" feature for easier maintenance. The large multi-level case that store the shaver, charger and hard shell compact travel case along with numerous other goodies (including a collector 1\/32 race car)are a bit over done and expensive. All very impressive for the special gift\/collector kind of person. It's all in how much the \"ultimate\" is worth to you.", "and only costs 10x as much.  But you get a nice toy car.  Norelco batteries are not easily replacable, so when this goes, you will want to fix it rather than just pitch it and get a new one, which will cost you nearly as much as buying a new less expensive Norelco.\n\nAnd the deluded that think this could be a collector's edition?  Maybe if you don't use it, but I don't care how rare it is, if you shaved with it you can keep it.  Well, unless you are some celebrity that can sell it on EBAY that is.\n\nGreat Razor.  Nice Case.  Cute toy car.  Worth about $150 tops.", "The 9199XL's Formula 1 racing heritage is evident from the moment its svelte yet muscular form rolls out of the box. It gleams under the lights, the low purr of its motor merely hinting at the roar of raw power that will soon follow. But make no mistake. This is no common wifebeater of a NASCAR shaver for the unshaved masses. It is a personal hygiene appliance of Formula 1 distinction.\n\nWhile others have crooned over the razor's patented reflex action, or waxed at length about the personal comfort control settings, some still measure the worth of an electric razor by its ability to quickly and closely relieve one of facial hair. The 9199XX succeeds wildly, largely due its innovative carbon fiber construction. The use of this lightweight space age material allows one to deftly maneuver the razor about the face at breakneck speeds, making hairpin turns around lips and other such obstacles with the grace and dexterity of a true thoroughbred. The Certificate of Authenticity that accompanies this sleek, limited edition marvel (only 175 units were fabricated) speaks to its pedigree. It is a great personal comfort to know that no more than 174 other U.S. consumers will ever experience the victory of owning the Philips Norelco 9199XL Limited Edition Formula 1 SmartTouch-SL Men's Shaving System."],

But--the shaver body is light weight and flimsy feeling and fits slightly awkwardly in my hand--its tapered body always wants to shift downwards and I end up holding it close to the shaving heads and then press too heavily; it sounds like a wind up toy; the trimmer is silly in terms of size, efficiency and convenience. Probably if I'd seen this razor it in a retail store and had the opportunity to get its 'hand feel' I wouldn't have bought it. The Norelco 'Jame Bond' surpasses this model across the board. I have another 40+ days and still may return the 1060, but every time I use it I continue to enjoy it\n3+ stars worth and will likely keep it. But I encourage buyers not to forget the easy return policy and hold on to your original sales receipt to keep all options available.", "The development of the arcitec shaver began as a challenge from Phillips' management to its engineers to create a razor that would finally convince users of conventional razors to turn electric. Although the shaving closeness does not match that of a Gillette razor 100% (and perhaps no electric shaver ever will), the results are considered stunning and revolutionary for an electric razor. The design and build are also very modern and trendy, and its an overall worthwhile investment for frequent travelers or anyone who dislikes wet shaving."],
    "description": "Norelco is evolving into Arcitec and it's a wonderful experience for your face. The 1060 is like the Maserati of shavers. From distinctive style to close, shaving somfort, it rides your contours precisely. Designed for JVC Everio Camcorders - Compatible with GZ-HD7 and GZ-MG555 models\nOffering a 360 degree swiveling shaving head and a state-of-the art sleek design, arcitec is the most advanced Philips Norelco shaver yet. Compared to other Philips Norelco shavers, arcitec offers new flex &amp; pivot technology, a more aerodynamic design, and an advanced tube trimmer.\nThe unique flex &amp; pivot technology delivers an exceptionally close shave. Three individually flexing shaving heads are connected by a ball joint system making them swivel, rotate, and pivot with a full range of motion. The maneuverability allows arcitec to adjust to the contours of your face ensuring optimum skin contact and a closer shave -- even on the neck. The new arcitec Shaver is designed to push the boundaries of shaving and to conquer those hard to shave areas.\nThe arcitec 1060 comes encased in a sophisticated silver chrome shell. Drawing inspiration from scientific and specialized instruments, this shaver is built with high density, lightweight materials. You know you are shaving with something extraordinary.\nCutting edge innovation doesn't stop with the shaver. Now you can recharge your shaver while you store it, with the Power Pod travel case that plugs into the wall and protects your investment. While at home, you can recharge your razor in its sleek stand and show off this modern addition to your bathroom shelf.\nFor those sideburns, goatees and moustaches, the new patented precision tube trimmer cuts hairs closer to the skin. This improved performance is due to the tube cutting system moving back and forth capturing every hair. All of these improvements and new introductions make it possible for you to conquer your neck to look and feel your best! Chart your course with the new Philips Norelco arcitec and be confident you're getting a perfectly close shave -- even on the neck.\n     Flex and Pivot Technology: Three independently flexing heads in a shaving unit that swivels 360 degrees for a full range of motion. This ensures optimum skin contact in curved areas, to catch even the most problematic hairs on your neck for a perfectly close shave, even in the hard to shave places.            State-of-the-Art Design: arcitec's 'central drive' technology makes it possible to design an ultra slim ergonomic body that fits snugly in your hand -- making it more comfortable to hold and effortless to use. The central drive technology connects all rotary blades to the shaving motor using only one spindle (axle) for a more comfortable grip.       Triple Track Shaving Heads: with up to 50% more shaving surface for a faster, smoother, closer shave. The Philips arcitec has more blades than traditional single-track shaving heads for more chances to catch and cut hair on every stroke. So you don't have to go over the same area to get a really close shave.      Superior Lift &amp; Cut&reg;Technology: The dual stainless steel blade system gently lifts hair to cut it comfortably below skin level, for an ultra close shave.       Advanced Tube Trimmer: Extends out from the body of the shaver -- perfect for trimming your sideburns, goatee, moustache -- then slide it back into the shaver to keep that sleek clean look! The new patented precision tube trimming technology lets you cut off hairs closer to the skin. The outer tube has slots to catch hairs and the inner tube oscillates to cut these hairs.       Precision Cutting System: Ultra-thin heads have slots to catch longer hairs and holes to shave short stubble. The stainless steel shaving heads are made very thin so they lie closer than ever against your skin to reach every hair.

Then remove every other strip (place the strips you remove back on the backing paper so they can be used individually).  Ta-da! Perfectly spaced lines.\n\n2.  Constitution - Skinny straight vinyls are much thicker than striping tape, which makes them more durable, and more suited to use in nail art, like sponging polish repeatedly over vinyls.  Striping tape is ultra-thin, and doesn't hold its shape well when used like a vinyl.\n\n3.  Stickiness - Striping tape loses its stickiness when exposed to the air, and if you try to reposition it, making for rough lines and leakage.  Skinny straight vinyls have serious stickiness, and create a seal between your nail and polish.\n\nSo, buy them!  They're worth it!", "I do a lot of nail art and I couldn't live without this tape. It's perfect for creating a load of patterns and you always get a crisp line when you use them. They're just the right amount of sticky so as not to peel off before you want them to, but won't pull off any polish you have beneath them either. A must have for any nail art lover!", "I've been a loyal customer of Whats Up Nails, and I gotta say their vinyls are great! Not only they're a good price, but I feel like they last a long time. I recommend their vinyls!"],
    "description": "How to Use   Apply nail polish on your nails and wait until completely dry. We recommend using fast dry top coat over nail polish or bare nails to create a flat surface which helps the product stick better. Make sure nail is dry and free of oily residues before applying product.   Lightly push tape\/stencils to the nail using a finger, especially paying attention to the areas near skin, cuticles, and the tips of long nails. You can always cut nail tape to size if they are too long and cut stencils to help them form better to the tip, sides and curvature of the nail. Try peeling stencils from different directions if you have trouble with smaller pieces not remaining on the backing paper. Find your direction and peel fast, holding stencil close the backing sheet. When small pieces remain within a stencil, flip and stick\/peel the stencil to the back of the paper to remove all stuck pieces.  Apply fresh or thinned, not thick or gloopy, nail polish across the tape\/stencil. Shimmer and metallic nail polishes work better than cremes. We recommend applying nail polish with a sponge lightly pushing it to your nail, similar to ombre design, this prevents any polish bleeding under the stencil giving cleaner lines. Remove extra nail polish from your skin and cuticles by using a flat brush dipped in acetone or nail polish remover.  Remove tape\/stencils immediately after applying nail polish using your fingers, tweezers or nippers while the polish is still wet. For better results pull the tape following its edges and stencils following the pattern.   Wait until your design has completely dried before applying top coat. Use fresh or thinned top coat, hold your brush parallel to your nail and try not to touch a nail with the brush, only the top coat drop should touch the nail to prevent smearing.  ",

    "description": "For centuries, the luxury of French-milled soaps has remained the gold standard of excellence. Each time you begin to lather a French made soap, you enter a time and place where quality and craftsmanship have stood still. Traditional French soap is triple-milled to produce a completely uniform and smooth soap, without impurities, thus lasting longer. Every bar of Pre de Provence soap is not only carefully made today by the dedicated soapmakers in Provence following their proud traditions, but quad-milled to be smoother and have a richer lather to create our luxurious feel. Using all pure, natural ingredients enriched with shea butter, you can feel the difference of our unique quad-milling process. Aromatic fragrances transport you to a moment of calmness, vitality, dreamin or well-being. This 150 Gram bar is a great value, the fragrance maintains until the soap is all used up.

    "description": "How to Use Eye-Press Instructions: Please watch a video at www.eye-press.com It is highly recommended that you start using this product when you first notice your symptoms and visit your eye-care professional as soon as possible: For Sties (Chalazia): use the eye-press every 2-3 hours for up to a week or until symptoms resolve. Take special care with small children as they may not stay still. For Blepharitis and Dry eyes: use as many as three times daily. For eyelid hygiene prior to surgery\/injection: start using product twice daily, at least 2 days prior your scheduled procedure. For all other conditions: Consult with your eyecare professional, but it is safe to use product two-three times daily until symptoms improve\/resolve. Directions of use 1) Take the compress out of the clear plastic bag, and moisten the white pad with clean (tap) water. 2) Hold the metal disk between your thumbs and your forefingers (use both hands), and bend the disk back and forth numerous times until you hear the disk click and see the blue liquid start to crystallize (turns white). 3) Grab the product by the clear handle between your thumb and forefinger (use one hand) and gently massage the product over your closed eyelid until the product cools down. Product stays warm for up to four minutes. Re-Use Instructions: Place the used eye-presses in a bowl of boiling water for about 3:30 minutes. You will notice the crystallized (white) liquid (inside the bag) turn blue again. Once completely clear, place the eye-presses on a clean dry place until the product cools down to room temperature. Be very careful not to spill the hot water or burn your hands (use tongs or a long fork). Before reusing, moisten the pad with a few drops of baby shampoo and tap water and bend the disk back and forth until you see the blue liquid start to crystallize again. Do NOT microwave. Do NOT reuse the product if you have an eye infection. Do NOT reuse product if the bag is broken and leaking.",

    "description": "How to Use   Apply nail polish on your nails and wait until completely dry. We recommend using fast dry top coat over nail polish or bare nails to create a flat surface which helps the product stick better. Make sure nail is dry and free of oily residues before applying product.   Lightly push tape\/stencils to the nail using a finger, especially paying attention to the areas near skin, cuticles, and the tips of long nails. You can always cut nail tape to size if they are too long and cut stencils to help them form better to the tip, sides and curvature of the nail. Try peeling stencils from different directions if you have trouble with smaller pieces not remaining on the backing paper. Find your direction and peel fast, holding stencil close the backing sheet. When small pieces remain within a stencil, flip and stick\/peel the stencil to the back of the paper to remove all stuck pieces.  Apply fresh or thinned, not thick or gloopy, nail polish across the tape\/stencil. Shimmer and metallic nail polishes work better than cremes. We recommend applying nail polish with a sponge lightly pushing it to your nail, similar to ombre design, this prevents any polish bleeding under the stencil giving cleaner lines. Remove extra nail polish from your skin and cuticles by using a flat brush dipped in acetone or nail polish remover.  Remove tape\/stencils immediately after applying nail polish using your fingers, tweezers or nippers while the polish is still wet. For better results pull the tape following its edges and stencils following the pattern.   Wait until your design has completely dried before applying top coat. Use fresh or thinned top coat, hold your brush parallel to your nail and try not to touch a nail with the brush, only the top coat drop should touch the nail to prevent smearing.  ",

Because I'm always focused on the fine lines around my eyes, that is where I focused when trying this wonderful product. I have tried the smaller version they have and like that this one covers more area at a time. The fact that it doesn't use batteries and recharges by plugging into a usb is such a plus.

It comes charges, so you can try it right away, it's simple to use, simply press the on button and the default setting will activate, which is a continuous vibration. if you press it again the setting will change to an interrupted vibration, more like pulse vibrations. It's easy to use, pleasant to the client and also a breeze to clean, I use a pre-moistened alcohol swab and wipe it off. The vibration activates the circulation on the face and the ion technology helps infuse the products deeper into the skin. It also came with a small vial of essential oils which is a nice touch.

I applied it to my hands and rubbed it in without any issue, although you can use the container to apply the cream, which would probably be a better idea since it's designed to be applied evenly. Since a little of the cream does the job, I expect to get about 2 months out of the container, which makes the $60 more palatable.\n\nOverall I like it. It's not something I would have ever tried on my own, but as a guy I'm vain and not above using something like this. But based on two weeks worth, I'm happy and would recommend it.

You only need a little bit of cream at a time, so I expect that the tube should last me several months with careful application.  I've been applying a pea size for each troublespot (each thigh and the backside).  It leaves a slightly cooling and tingly feeling which lasts for a bit.  I found that it makes me more conscious of the area as well, encouraging me to do more spot exercises, which is a good thing.

It compares well to the Estee Lauder Body Performance Slim Shape Anti-Cellulite Visible Contouring Cream that I'd used in the past. I'd say it is just as effective."],

The strip acts in place of a scab to seal in your body's own natural healing fluids and seal out water, dirt and germs that can cause infection. The strip restores the skin to a natural moisture level by absorbing fluids from the injured skin and allowing excess moisture to evaporate. As the strip absorbs moisture from the wound, a white gel cushion will form over the wound to provide extra protection. And like a scab, the strip will work best when left on the wound and in place for as long as possible. Leave the strip in place for several days for optimal healing. Each hypoallergenic, multi-day use bandage measures 1-3\/4 by 2-3\/4 inches. Sterility is guaranteed unless the individual wrapper is opened or damaged.\n\n",

Placed in a fridge, the Nano Wand's energy frequency permeates the fridge; all liquids, meat and fruit will taste better and have extended shelf life. The renewed molecular chains are similar to those found in healthy natural spring water. Like fruit and vegetables, the body slowly also loses molecular chains as we age. They can be re-energized at a molecular level to provide energy, using the Nano Wand. The hydratious nature of water is important to wellness. Molecular structured water carries improved oxygen flow to the blood, assists in detoxification of free radicals, improves liver detoxification, and improves nutrient take up by the body.

DON'T TRUST THIS DEALER PLEASE PEOPLE DON'T  find someone else to buy your hair from.\n\nYou will be sorry if you do, I will NEVER buy from this seller again I will go to YELP and other sites and post BAD REVIEWS on this company\n\nI'm not a novice when it comes buying hair on line, I shop faithful at beauty supplies, I tried to do something different this company I chose to give my $180.00 to and was so disappointed. My daughters are very knowledgeable when it comes to buying VIRGIN hair online, I'm sadden they weren't around when I invested my hard earned money in this this messy, smelly, bad grade HAIR. When I received this hair that said BRAZILIAN HUMAN HAIR we noticed the hair wasn't going in one direction but very uneven and short pieces flying everywhere- I'm talking the hair supposed to be a 16 inch some pieces mixed with it was a 12inch much shorter. Not only that, it don't curl at all, please don't buy from this seller or any seller that doesn't have HAIR in their name. I'VE LEARNED my lesson. I contact the seller told them how they misrepresented their product how are u going to advertise curly hair and send me straight then tell me I should have told them. Online we can ONLY see we can't touch or distinguish any other way, we must trust in the person and hope they are good people and will give you what your money paid for. I went to YOUTUBE and looked up this type of hair NOTHING LIKE WHAT I RECEIVE PEOPLE PLSE Research before sending your money to these people who doesn't care about great customer service but want to rip people off. THE HAIR STUNK BACK like a burning tree... OMG... this experience I will learn from. I don't\nmind paying for good quality things I am a serious hair fanatic searching for a good company who I can trust that has GOOD HAIR for me and my customers.\n\nI will not refer this company to anyone. I don't want you to go through this heart break. This hair I have is regular HUMAN HAIR SILKY STRAIGHT not virgin, Brazilian, cuticle THIS COMPANY isn't a hair company I received my product in an old old reused shipping envelop, RED FLAG...\n\nI didn't send this hair back because someone said they will not refund you the money although they said they would, I don't trust them, they will get this cheap hair and keep it and my money. I will give it to someone who's not into REMY or Virgin hair - one who just needs some silky straight hair for free. I'm searching now to BUY SOME GOOD and quality hair the REAL Virgin Hair, hopely I can find it place an order today and receive quality hair that will free me from this nightmare. If anyone who reads this brought hair (GOOD HAIR) from a great seller plse send me a message.\n\n It's so hard now for me to trust this companies --- wow", "February 11th: I got my hair today and I am IN LOVE WITH IT!! It is very soft and feels natural. I am going to have it installed on Monday and will write a review once the hair is installed. I will come back with a 1-month update and then a final update on how the hair did through washing and styling.\n\nFebruary 21st: I got my hair installed on Feb. 13th and I just washed it on the 19th using a sulfate free shampoo. The hair sheds really bad. It looks dull and lifeless. It still feels soft but when I straightened the hair it felt extremely hard and stiff with no body or volume which was strange. I'm not sure if this is really \"Virgin\" hair but after the first wash the hair does act weird.", "I just ordered two bundles of 16 inch 1b of this hair three days ago and it got here already. I am very happy about that. The hair seems nice, but I did find a few gray hairs in one of the bundles - otherwise I would have given it a 5 star rating. The hair isn't shedding and doesn't tangle when I run my fingers through it. I am going to co-wash the hair and have it installed next week. I'll update after I have it sewn in. So far so good, though. If this goes well, I'll definitely buy more hair from this company.\n\nI had this hair installed about two weeks ago and I am very happy with it. I've been wearing it in its natural state with no heat or products. I co-wash it twice a week. I've had very little shedding. I'm planning to keep the hair in for two months and hope to use it again. I'll definitely be buying more hair from this company."],

    "reviewText": ["MY FIRST ELECTRIC SHAVER WAS A NORELCO SC 7960, A TWO HEADED SPEED SHAVER, WHICH I STILL OWN.THAT WAS 47 YEARS AGO AT AGE 17. I THEN USED A MODEL 805, PURCHASED IN 1992, WHICH WAS MY FIRST RECHARGEABLE TRIPLE HEADED NORELCO.BOTH THESE RAZORS GAVE ME AN EXCELLENT SHAVE WITHOUT ANY IRRITATION, SINCE I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN.I JUST PURCHASED THE NORELCO 8260 AND WOW. WHAT A CLOSE SHAVE.YOUR RAZORS HAVE AGED WELL WITH QUALITY AND THERE ISN'T A BETTER SHAVER ON THE MARKET.I HAVE TRIED FOILED RAZORS IN THE PAST,BUT I ALWAYS COME BACK TO NORELCO. I AM A VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER.", "I bought this shaver to replace my old Norelco shaver that I'd been using for many years, and that finally broke.  This one was about double the price of that one, but I'm very disappointed to have to deal with the large \"cleaning system\" that came with the new shaver.  The picture on Amazon shows the shaver in a cute little stand; the reality is that it comes with a huge cleaning stand that I have no room for.  It seems the electric shaving folk want to get into the razor\/razor blades game, by selling cleaning solution for the shavers.  I'm not sure how important this is; my old one lasted very well with just a weekly \"dry clean\".  It also seems environmentally unfriendly to be wasting some water every day, and throwing out a plastic bottle every month or so.\n\nIn addition to the cleaning stand being bulky, a terrible design decision is that you can't leave the shaver plugged into it, because it will harm battery life.  Having something this big is bad enough, but having to unplug it all the time is ridiculous.\n\nThe packaging is the old horrible packaging, with unopenable plastic over everything, not the new Amazon environmentally friendly packaging.\n\nOn the other hand, the shaver works as well as the old one, and you can just ignore the cleaning stand if you want, since the recharger can plug directly into the shaver.  I'd probably be perfectly happy with the shaver if it had come that way; the extra stuff just seems wasteful.", "I just got the 8260 Norelco to replace my other 2 shavers(a Braun 8995 and a Panasonic Nano). This shaver is superior to both of my prior shavers,and here's why:\n 1. There is the noise issue. The Panasonic was annoyingly loud, the Braun was quite noisy, but the 8260 is very quiet. This may seem trivial,but it is nice to shave in peace.\n 2. The 8260 shaver truly shaves in one or two passes, and is completely non-irritating from the get-go. The Panasonic gets a little burny on the tough spots,and must be held at a specific angle to perform with it's angled blade technology and that is very annoying. The Braun requires multiple passes everywhere. Neither of the 2 foil razors EVER shaved my neck sufficiently, but the Norelco 8260 does an outstanding job there. I know they say a foil shaver shaves closer, but the Norelco far out-performs these 2 foils.\n 3. The build quality of of the Norelco and Braun are very solid, but the Panasonic seems cheap and flimsy. Also,replacement blades are cheaper on the Norelco,and you can't even find Panasonic replacements anywhere, so you have to order them from their site.\n 4. They all come with cleaning stands, which are gimmicky junk,in my opinion,but the Norelco version is the nicest. I wouldn't have bought any of these with the cleaning system,but these were either gifts or the same price with the claning stands. If I could save $40 or $50 bucks,I'd buy a model that didn't come with the cleaner (Braun 8975 or Norelco 8240).\n 5. The Panasonic allows wet shaving in shower or with foam, but I tried it once with foam and it was a mess. I prefer the simplicity of dry shaving.\n 6. The charge on the Norelco lasts WAAAYYYYYY longer that the other two shavers. It lasts like 2 weeks , and the other two only stay charged for a week\n Ultimately I am very impressed and surprised at the shave I get from the Norelco 8260 Rotary shaver. I have always purchased foils due to hearing they shave closer, but I can state clearly that that is not the case with me. I would buy a Braun again( it is very well-made and reliable),but I would not buy a Panasonic."],

It had so much slippage that it left sticky residue on my natural hair and knotted it all up. As for other reviews that are bad all I can say is that it depends a lot on how your hair stylist puts them in. It is a long process that needs to be handled with care. It is best to remove your previous tape and wash all the extensions and let them dry before placing them back into your hair with fresh tape. I think this is a great tape for extensions! I am expecting this to last for another 5 weeks from my experience.", "I am very conservative with my reviews, as I understand how much it can affect the success of any given business on Amazon.  However, I feel compelled to let other prospective buyers how bad this extension tape sucks.  The worst tape I've ever used, hands down.  I cannot tell you how angry and disappointed I was.  Not even taking into consideration the money I spent buying this tape, I care little about that.  What REALLY chaps my hide is how much time I invested in researching extension tape, all of the BS hype online about how this tape was the \"holy grail\" ... I invested A LOT of time applying both the tape to brand new wefts, and the wefts to my hair, only to have over 50% fall out after my first wash.\nI'm no rookie when it comes to extensions and\/or tape extensions.  I am well-educated with regard to application instructions, etc.  I've used Walker Tape in the past, with negligible results, however due to all of the \"online fanfare\" ie. \"AFTER TWO YEARS OF RESEARCH, THIS IS OUR BEST TAPE YET!\" I trusted Walker, and used this tape to apply a full head of brand new, very expensive hair extensions, only to discover 3 days later, after washing for the first time, that these tabs were COMPLETE CRAP. A perfect example of marketing propaganda.  I have no idea what Walker was doing for those \"two years in development,\" however I guarantee it had nothing to do with creating a breakthrough product.  TOTAL GARBAGE.", "I realllllly wanted to like this tape, but it ended up being a massive disappointment. I ordered this as the Hairlocs tape I usually use was out of stock and I really needed my weave redid. The Hairlocs tape held solid for 7 weeks with only 2 wefts slipping (probably due to me getting product too close to the adhesive). Even then, I was able to press them back together. But the Walker tape was awful. The first week I had 4 wefts slip out and I had to reschedule my weave touch up 2 weeks after I had it done because this tape just wasn't holding. There goes another $200! Every time I wash (being very careful not to use conditioner anywhere near the adhesive), more fall out.  I'm not sure if it was user error since one side of the adhesive is designed for the weft and one side for human hair- but the instructions on the package are minimal. Save yourself the time and money and use something else. When the Hairlocs tape is in stock, order that, it's amazing!"],

    "description": "It has been shown that a body that is pH balanced absorbs more nutrients from both supplements and foods. You get increased effectiveness and value from the supplements you purchased and more nutrients from the food you eat when you have a balanced pH level.   Higher Level Nutritionals AlkaMe has been rigorously tested and ingeniously formulated to not only provide immediate acidity reduction to create an optimal pH for absorption of supplements and foods, but includes another set of ingredients designed to improve and maintain a balanced pH for the long-haul.   If you are not getting the desired results you were looking for from your supplement, training or nutritional program, look for an acid alkaline imbalance. Your body is able to assimilate minerals and nutrients properly only when your pH is balanced. Acidic blood blocks vitamin absorption and starves your body of essential components. When the body drops below 6.4 pH, enzymes are deactivated, digestion is impaired; vitamins, minerals and supplements cannot be effectively assimilated. Even the most well laid-out supplement, nutritional or training program may not be producing results because of a severe lack in absorption due to an improper pH balance.   When healthy, the pH of Blood is 7.4, the pH of the spinal fluid is 7.4 and the pH of saliva is 7.4. Oxygen levels in the body are directly related to pH. Unfortunately, Most Americans have a pH level around 6.2 to 6.4, which invites numerous ailments and diseases associated with elevated acid levels",

    "reviewText": ["After reading the reviews at Amazon.com and at a site that reviews electric razors, I choose the Braun 6520.  It was rated high and its price was half of the leading razor.  I also crossed check the price against other retailers and Amazon.com was [less expensive] and shipped one day sooner.\nI have a tough beard that grows fast coupled with a tender face.  My Remington 300 was the first razor to allow me to use an electric shaver and make it through the day without looking like a beatnik; however, after 5 years the screens are impossible to find so it was time for a new shaver.  The new Braun came as advertised and was charged up the very first time in only 4 hours versus 14 for my old 300.  The charged and low charge lights are handy and the ability to charge a dead razor for a shave in 3 minutes is a great advantage.  I have found in the past that a preshave liquid improves the closeness of the shave and that has been true with the Braun as well.  By the third day my face had adjusted to the shaver and I am getting the closest shave ever with no skin irritation.  The shaver also does a great job with neck hairs and the occasional long hair.  One significant reason that I selected this razor was the changing of the screen and cutters at 18 months.  My old 300 required a screen or screen\/cutter replacement every 6 months so this saves $30 over that 18 month period.  When selecting a razor be sure to pay attention to this or any \"self-cleaning\" liquids that you have to purchase on a regular basis.  The 6520 uses a floating head but is switchable to lock the head for hard areas like under the nose.  I found that I still get the best shave by moving my hand against the grain of the hair before I run the shaver there and you will want to shave against the grain too.  This was required with my old 300 and is indicative of most foil razors.  This is not required of rotary shavers but most research that I read indicates that a foil provides a closer shave.\nI am very happy with this razor.  It works great!", "Braun 6520 is the best electric shaver made. I've tried a\nRemington and it is junk, you get a excellent smooth shave,\njust as good as a razor blade. I recommend the Braun 6520, to\nall men that are using razor blades, you will never use a razor blade again.", "Most men say that the only way to get rid of those neck hairs is with a rotary razor. It's NOT TRUE! I get an excellent and thorough shave every mourning. I've tried the rest, but Braun is the BEST! One charge seeems to last forever. I take it camping with me for a week or so ....no problem."],
    "description": "This electric razor has a head that oscillates from side to side at high speed and pivots to adjust to the face's contours. In addition, the razor offers a three-stage cutting system and delivers a smooth shave either with or without a cord. The razor has a pop-up trimmer for mustache and sideburns and works worldwide on 110- to 240-volt systems. It recharges fully in one hour for 60 minutes of shaving time or charges in three minutes for a quick shave. The three-stage cutting system consists of a cutting block between two foils, with each unit performing individually as the razor runs across the face. For difficult shaving areas, such as under the nose, the pivoting head locks into position. The shaver carries a 30-day, full-refund guarantee and a two-year warranty against defects (foil and cutter block excluded). --Fred Brack",

Definitely noticing softening of lines on the skin around my eyes.", "I started using this skin care line as someone who doesn't always devote the appropriate time or attention to my daily skin routine. Committed to the experiment, I found myself looking *forward* to my new daily\/nightly skin regimen. The cleansing elixir is light but still lathers up nicely. The lip balm is something I carry around daily, has a refreshing, minty smell, and leaves a nice, soft sheen. The age defying cream can be used sparingly, but after spending too much time in the sun one weekend, I found that it saved my face from becoming overly dry\/painful, and prevented excess peeling, which always seems to happen to me. My favorite part of the package is the hydrating rose mist, which allowed me to experience a nightly spa-like experience in my own bathroom. I would highly recommend this entire line to anyone looking to make a worthy investment into the future of their skin.", "My wife loves these products, especially the lip balm.

When I got this one I immediately loved it 10 times better than my old hard rock sponge. For the price, it beats the $20 beauty blender any day! it's soft on the skin and it blends my foundation in so well. I would recommend this for anyone with dry skin due to the moisture coming from the damp sponge. It does give me an airbrushed finish! However, it does stain easily like any other sponge, so I like to wash it with a baby soap after every use to help avoid stains and bacterial growth. I also like how this one has an angled side! I can use the angled part for under my eye area, and it really helps the process!! You are going to love this makeup sponge!\n*UPDATE*\nI used this sponge twice now, and the sponge is still really soft!\nIt didn't shrink into a hard sponge like my old ones, even after it's completely dried! Very impressed!\n\n*Disclaimer*\nI was fortunate enough to have received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "This sponge has elevated the same old make-up spnges we have been using for years.  It is so great that someone has finally thought of a way to make these perform better.  I love this sponge.  I noticed right away the difference in the amount of makeup that goes on the sponge compared to the older kind.  There is significant amounts less!  I love the idea that the makeup I am paying good money for is going on my face and not on a sponge. It has such a nice shape which makes it easy to hold and I especially like the angle at the top for getting under my eyes and other smaller spots.  The sponge is easy to wash but I don't need to wash it as much as my other ones due to the makeup being much less in the sponge.  I would buy this product again as well as recommend it.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.", "Recieved product at a discounted price.

You can make these hairstyles as tight or as loose as you want depending on how much hair you gather in the pin as you flip it, so it's good for those that have a lot of hair to wrangle as well as those who get headaches if their hair is pulled back tightly.  If you have past your shoulders that is wavy or curly (like the model in the diagrams) I think that is ideal, but I think you can make it work with most hair types.\n\nFor less than $5 for a 2-pack it's worth a try, and if it doesn't work for you, pass it on to a friend with a different hair length\/texture.", "Love it"],

    "reviewText": ["I can't rave enough about the Braun Syncro!  It is the best shave I've ever gotten out of an electric.  I will say that the blade is still closer, but you get 95% there without the mess or skin irritation.  The biggest advantage is that you never have to clean or oil it manually.  Just drop it into the Clean & Charge base and forget about it.  It is always clean and ready to go!  This unit also has the longest charge-hold that I've ever seen.  I only need 3-4 minutes to shave each day, so the shaver only has to charge about once every 2 weeks!  There is one drawback that I have found:  The unavailability of the cleaning cartridges.  Hardly anyone carries this little cartridge.  I visited the large retailers in my areaincluding Wal-Mart, Target, and K-Mart and no one carries it.  A Target employee said they did carry them, but wouldn't be stocking them anymore.  I would hate to have to buy them directly from Braun.", "I always used either Braun shavers or blades. The blades were a hassle and the electrics didn't cut it, when I hadn't shaved for a few days. I also never liked cordless shavers. Had one and it just didn't feel as 'strong'. The batteries were always weak. This one has all of the above fixed. I don't even remember anynmore where I've put my blades the last time. The batteries last for more then a week of daily shaving, and it runs at full power until the last minute. The display tells you exactly how much shaving time you have left (and it is accurate). The cleaning feature is just the best. No need to use brushes anymore and it always feels fresh and smooth. It even cuts through a long weekend beard with ease. I love it. Some reviewers complained about the bad supply of cartridges. I just ordered mine right here and they are in stock. If you don't clean it every day, but only every other then the cartridge lasts for more then two month.  Compare that with the cost for the overpriced Mach3 blades.", "I have had them all but this one is the best! it really shaves close and the cleaning system is great,the only negetive thing is those darn cleaning cartridge is so hard to find,heck everybodys out of them. you may not want to try this at home but this is what I did,I filled the cartridge up with rubbing alcohol,It works great seeing that the cleaning solution has alcohol in it,what the hey! it works,sorry Braun!"],

It was a definite smack myself in the forehead moment. It's far from \"just a cleanser\" as I originally thought. It's a cleanser & serum in 1! This brand is based on having minimal steps & not needing to layer products so I should have known the cleanser had something special to it. As you cleanse your skin soaks up the lactic acid & other great ingredients. My skin had already shown significant changes from using Vertere's Cream...now after using the cleanser too I've seen even more. I use this cleanser in the morning & another at night - just from 1x per day I've definitely noticed improvement. My acne scarring is starting to lighten, I've had less breakouts, & in some areas my pores seem a little smaller. This cleanser is different then any other cleanser I've ever used - it has the consistency of a serum, it doesn't foam up, create suds, or honestly even seem like a cleanser when you are using it. But then you rinse your face w\/hot water & find your skin is so soft, it doesn't feel dry like with almost every other cleanser, & if you use their whole line all that's left is to put a tiny amount of their Dramatic Transformation Cream. No toner, no serum, no 5 layers of products...just this cleanser & the cream (& they just came out with an eye cream too!) & I just have to point out that I have been searching for \"the\" products for years now. I've tried several skincare lines, but found nothing that made enough of a difference that it was worth buying again. I always have just finished using it then ordered something different (unless it was horrible & then of course I tossed it). Well...I have finally found \"the ones\"! Vertere is amazing. (After all the products I've tried I thought I would always be settling or I'd be using 10 products to get the results I wanted. I never thought I'd call any skincare product amazing.) I can honestly say this is it, I've found it!! No more searching. Both the cleanser & the cream will stay a part of my routine - really they will be my routine since the whole principal is not to have to layer or use several products! Vertere products are a little pricey but sooo worth it. I hope this helps you decide. I can honestly say I have never written a review for a skincare product before - wasn't worth my time but Vertere's products are that good - it feels wrong not to tell everyone just how good."],
    "description": "Vertere Skin Care Refining Treatment Cleanser effectively addresses a significant challenge. Typically, cleansers designed to help improve the appearance of acne strip the skin of precious moisture which aggravates blemishes and wrinkles. Many cleansers designed for mature skins are often too rich for oilier and combination skins - especially those still experiencing breakouts. Refining Treatment Cleanser is an exceptional composition that strikes that elusive balance. Skin is left firm and soft with lines visibly diminished while improving the appearance of blemishes. Skin appears airbrushed. True to our multitasking ethos, Refining Treatment Cleanser also removes non-waterproof eye makeup. Use morning and evening to cleanse the skin without stripping vital moisture. Massage four pumps of cleanser onto damp skin in circular motions. To remove light, non-waterproof eye makeup, massage cleanser over closed eyes for ten seconds. Rinse face with tepid water; pat dry.",

So, I have tried a few sticks like Arko, and this is comparable. For me, I like the Arko better for lubrication and I seem to get a better, less irrated shave and give that 5 stars. With the Valobra I don't get as pleasurable of a shave, and I really should rate this 4 stars... but this smells so much better than the Arko. Arko smells like Ivory, this smells like it's from the heart of Italy, and what a great smell it is.\nSo, in summary, I do like this stick, not the greatest shave but it makes up for it in smell.", "To the folks above who say this product isn't as good as other creams\/soaps...it's imperative that you use this correctly.

I replaced the foil and blades for 40.00 (what a rip off)but I kept switching between my old Norelco and the Braun model. This year I decided to treat myself to the newer Norelco 8250 XL. Its fantastic. Much better than my old Norelco and outclasses my newer Braun shaver.\n  However. before buying this Norelco, I decided to read some personal reviews. Most reviews were positive but there were a number of really bad ones. So I was skeptical. But I liked my old Norelco's and decided to give them another shot. I'm very glad I did.\n  Frankly, I cant understand the bad reviews. The only thing I can figure is that the people who complained did not follow the manufactures recommendations before shaving. When I was in a hurry, I often shaved without washing and cleaning my face and was not at all pleased with the results. Pulling my beard, scratchy feeling and some irritation. But every time I wash and clean my face, my shave is EXCELLENT. If you follow the recommendation of washing and cleaning your face you won't be disappointed. Kudo's to Philips.\n  While there are more expensive Norelco's on the market, you won't go wrong with this model. For the price, (I bought it at Macy's for $79.99 and got a 10% discount with a coupon my wife had recieved in the mail), it was a steal.\n  Do yourself a big favor and buy this model or a similar Norelco model and you won't regret it.", "unfortunatly I have found this product the  norelco 8240xl to compare most unfavorably with the norelco spectra 8831xl,which I consider to be  far superior to the latest, the Norelco arcitec."],

This dose not leave my skin red, or irrratated. It left my skin really smooth. It smells amazing too, that was the first thing I noticed. It has a conditioner like feel to it so it is soft and fluffy and not graniy. It spreads very easily and evenly compared to having clumps of foam on your skin. The after effect are way better than I had expected, my skin was completely smooth and soft like a baby. I like it so much I have changed my shavig cream. I recommend this to any woman or man that is looking for smoother skin after a shave. I also use this for my legs and under arms with the same results. I truly love this product.\n\nI received this item free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.", "This product was received for free or discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I have incredibly sensitive skin and am very selective with unknown brands because I could easily (and often) break out with hives or an ugly rash. So far in using this product, neither has happened! I have noticed that my skin is softer and has not attained the redness that usually lingers with other shaving products. And unlike some other lotions, creams, etc that I have tried in the past this doesnt gunk up my razor! Thats a small victory already, because now my regular razor lasts longer when using this easily, rinse- able product. Swimsuit season is on the horizon, and this shave cream will definitely come to your rescue.", " I have to admit when I was first asked to try this I said no just because of the name, I'm wondering now when I became a prude. I mentioned this to a couple of friends and they said, \"you have to try it, it's amazing\". I responded to peer pressure and here I am writing a review for something called Coochy Plus. :-)\n\nFirst, the tube is huge, you get a lot more than I anticipated. When I tried it the first thing I noticed is the scent, at first I have to admit that I didn't like it but I think it is because I'm not use to scented items, Typically when I shave I use Dove soap followed by Bikini Zone which has been a perfectly fine combination but this does a much better job. When I was done shaving I actually liked the scent so that was no longer an issue.\n\nThe biggest difference just in initial use between this and shaving cream and soap is that there is no lather which took me a bit to get use to. I felt like I had to use a lot of it but again, that could be because I am not use to this product.\n\nWhen I was done shaving my skin was noticeably smoother than using any other product I've used in the past. Even in my video review I put it on the back of my hand and when I wiped it off I noticed my hand was super soft. My shave seemed to last at least a day longer than usual if not longer which is obviously a good thing. I didn't notice any bumps or irritation, also a good thing, and I have fairly sensitive skin which includes eczema and I didn't have any issue there either.\n\nI will admit that this is still going to take some getting use to on my part and I'm interested to see how quickly I go through the tube but for now I really like the product. I do want to say that you need to make a point to double check the ingredients to make sure you are not allergic to anything that is in it (I show them on the video part of my review) but there are a lot of natural ingredients and my sensitive skin did fine.\n\nI do believe this is going to be a to each his (her) own product but for now I'm impressed, if I could just get past the name. :-)\n\nI received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review."],

This was the million-dollar idea of Yoganshi Shah and Hiral Sanghavi. Eventually their goal is to incorporate their background of electronics and software to create smart apparel!\nConvenience on the go. That is what Yoganshi Shah thought of when her husband, Hiral Sanghavi, kept forgetting his neck pillow when he travelled.

Yoganshi had a brilliant idea of creating a jacket that essentially embodies everything has a place, and everything in its place. The outcome was a functional jacket designed for accessibility and comfort. The BauBax jacket has 15 features that helps all travelers and people on-the-go stay organized with pockets for a tablet, smart phones, sunglasses, and even a drink pocket. To add to the overall functionality, there is space to hold earphones, built-in eye mask, gloves that extend from the sleeves, and comes with a microfiber cloth to keep all eyewear sparkly clear. Of course it has the built-in neck pillow that will not be left at home again.\nYou likely never heard of a travel jacket before Baubax, but it's the jacket you always needed but never existed.\nIt is good to have clothing that solves problems you face in your day-to-day life.

It encompasses the range of wavelengths from 570 nm to 620 nm.\n\nHow Does It Work & What Is It Good For:\nAmber light has quite a shallow skin penetration but is effective in the treatment of skin issues involving redness, such as spider veins. Though it is not typically used for tissue healing or collagen\/elastin production, where it excels is in the treatment of problems such as sun damage. It is often considered to be an ideal therapy for sensitive skin, as its therapy is calming and soothing. Amber light therapy is frequently recommended as a drug free alternative treatment for skin redness and flushing, irritation, rosacea, UV radiation damage, and reducing the appearance of the tiny blood vessels on the nose and face. It helps to flush waste from the skin, boost lymphatic flow, and increase cellular growth. Orange light returns a vitality to skin that has lost its sheen. Especially recommended for wedding days and portraits, orange light works on dull complexions to bring out a brilliant healthy glow.\n\nHow Often Should I Use It:\n4 to 6 times a week for the first 2 to 3 weeks, then at least 3 times a week for at least 3 months. The more and longer you use it the better results you will get.\n\nBenefits of amber light:\nImprovements you can see  amber light therapy reduces redness, evens out the complexion and calms irritated skin. When used regularly, this means visible, ongoing benefits for many rosacea sufferers.\nBenefits that start working fast  no rosacea treatment is immediate, but many users of amber light therapy for rosacea find that this treatment works faster and more consistently than most other products they have ever tried.\nQuick and easy treatments  treating the entire face can be as fast as 4.5 minutes per day.\nSide effect-free  when LED amber light therapy is used according to the product directions, there are no known side effects linked to its regular use.\nPortable  both the bulb and the clamp light (sold separately) are light, small and durable so that you won't have to skip out on treatments just because you won't be at home.
