Two days in a row she's worn these through the hustle and bustle of school, playground time, and karate class, and her pony was just as tight when I took it down that evening as it was when I put it in that morning!\nShe loves the designs, and I like having something a little different from her normal bows and ribbons.

I was really surprised at first how little irritation there was.  My old Norelco was giving a bit of irriatation in places, but no problems with this one, even though it was a new razor.

The plant itself was about 6 inches tall with no leaves (as seems standard for most plant companies).  Leaves began appearing within two weeks of arrival.

I even used it on my Virgin Indian Remy weave hair, and it didn't require conditioning, afterward.", "The first time I used this shampoo bar, I really didn't like the way it made my hair feel, tangled and kind of greasy.  But I had heard your hair or scalp has to adjust to shampoo bars so I kept using it.  After a few days I have really come to love how soft and manageable my hair has become. It also leaves your body nice and moisturized and so smooth too!  I also use the Tasmania conditioner bar just on the ends of my hair and it compliments this bar very nicely.  No tangles, soft and bouncy hair!  I am a blonde, which has been damaged by highlighting my more brassy dirty blonde natural hair color and it was really in bad condition.  Most shampoos will further dry out my hair, this bar doesn't at all and it does have a pleasant clean scent, nothing overpowering just a hint of a fruity or citrus scent.  It looks like I barely used it so it will last a long time, just be sure to keep it out of the shower when not using it or it may melt (especially the conditioning bar).  Overall I love both products and would order again.  Still waiting on my Lush order to see if they are worth the heftier price tag.

    "reviewText": ["Like many of the other 1-star reviews said, this stuff has some nasty side effects. Within two days, my mouth and tongue developed numerous sores, and my tongue often tingled and began going numb. It wasn't catastrophic, but it was a constant source of irritation. I stopped after about 5 days, and within a few days, the sores healed and my tongue felt normal again.\n\nI don't know why this stuff is so caustic, but I have never had this experience with other mouthwashes. Even Crest's regular Pro-Health Rinse I am a fan of. But something just isn't right about this stuff.\n\nI wonder if it has to do with the hydrogen peroxide; tucked away under \"inactive ingredients\" is hydrogen peroxide (which is not an ingredient in the regular Pro-Health Rinse). I've used hydrogen peroxide as a mouthwash before, and it can be mildly irritating at first (though far less so than this stuff). I wonder what the concentration is; it's not listed because hydrogen peroxide is an \"inactive\" ingredient (even though it probably contributes to the reversal of gingivitis). The hydrogen peroxide you buy at the store is only 3% and it doesn't bother my mouth (although it can burn somewhat when you first start). If this stuff is more concentrated, that could explain it. Or maybe it's something about the overall chemical composition. Maybe hydrogen peroxide reacts with the active ingredient, cetylpyridinum chloride. Or maybe the increase from 0.07% to 0.1% cetylpyridinum chloride is more than the mouth can handle (though I doubt it).\n\nWhatever the case, this stuff doesn't belong in a human mouth. Maybe if you're a paid subject and have to use it the full 2 weeks it may in fact reverse gingivitis, but it's not worth it. There are other options. If you have gingivitis, brush with (3%) hydrogen peroxide for a week or two; that did the trick for me.", "I just won't provide my opinion but what the dental hygienist said during my last dental cleaning.  \"Your home healthcare is excellent\".  Good results with no side effects.", "I first started using this product after I had some dental work. I could not deal with the burn of regular alcohol since I had my gums cut into. It did not burn at all and made my teeth white from the peroxide, but every time I used it, I would spit out a slimy substance. I figured it was plaque or something similar. After about four days of using it twice a day, I noticed my tongue was slightly numb and it felt as if I had burnt it on hot food. I used the mouthwash again after my tongue started hurting and it stung very bad (This being a mouthwash that doesn't burn) To make it worse, I can hardly taste any food. It does not matter how strong or salty it is. It has now been three days since I stopped using this terrible product and my mouth no longer hurts, but my taste is still gone. I hope it comes back soon. This product is the equivalent of getting a chemical peel done in your mouth. It should be removed from the market.

I cannot say that it has had any \"brightening\" effect.  It does not feel like it adds any moisture, so was basically a useless step in my routine.

I flossed after using it and didn't find anything, anymore.  I cannot wait to have my next cleaning.  Before Philips Sonicare toothbrush, there was work to be done at each cleaning.  Less and less as the flexible toothbrush does a wonderful job.  I can tell this is another excellent product from Philips and I am grateful to them.  Life if easier w\/o using the classic floss and flossing is a pleasure with Airfloss.", "I don't like that when I use it, water is running down your chin; also my dental hygienist recommended it for a couple of troublesome areas in my mouth.  When I use this on this two spots, I not only have water running down my chin, but blood as well.  It's too rough on the sensitive areas.", "I was excited to get this AirFloss because I love my Sonicare toothbrush, which has given years of good service.  What a disappointment this new product is!  First of all it does not floss your teeth.  Floss goes between your teeth vertically from gum line to tip, and floss also cleans out the gum line along the horizontal length of the tooth.  This product sends a millisecond long jet of air and water only at the top of the tooth near the gum, where the gap is in most people's teeth.  It does not clean along the entire space that separates adjacent teeth, and it does not clean along the body of the tooth along the gum line.  The instructions say only to use it on the buccal surface of teeth (the cheek side), not on the inside (tongue side).  Therefore, this product only cleans one specific spot: the outer facing tooth surface between teeth, and only just at the top where there is a little gap between the teeth.  It gets about 1\/10 of the surface reached by string flossing.\n\nSecondly, even when used as directed, the AirFloss squirts water all over the bathroom.  Feel like washing the bathroom mirror?  Just use this product and your mirror will be covered with water droplets mixed with spit.  Disgusting.  Not to mention the fact that if the jet hits your tongue (which it invariably does a couple times during each use), it stings like a bee.\n\nUse this product as directed then floss your teeth afterwards. You will find that the floss comes out just as covered with schmutz as it would had you not \"flossed\" with an AirFloss.  This product simply does not work, causes tongue pain, and then you have to clean the bathroom sink and mirror when you are done.\n\nI'm returning mine today.\n\nBTW, I did not buy this at Amazon.  But the product was so stunningly bad that I logged in to my Amazon account just to warn prospective buyers.  If you know of a flossing product that effectively replaces or surpasses the old fashioned string kind, please leave a comment on this post.  Thanks!"],

Since eye pillows block out light and relax muscles, they are ideal for a variety of therapeutic uses including, nap therapy, massage therapy, meditation, resting fatigued eyes, and, of course, savasana. These pillows can be safely chilled in the freezer in a sealed plastic bag or warmed in the microwave for approximately 20 seconds. The gentle weight of the flax seed allows the pillow to smoothly and comfortably adapt to individual facial contours. Different essential oils may provide relief from stress, anxiety, or headaches.

I've used it both on its own and before using paraffin on my feet.\n\nI'm lucky enough to be able to shop Moon Valley locally but for anyone not in the Seattle area, I would definitely recommend trying them out."],

I will disclose that I was given the opportunity to purchase at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion and review.  This in no way swayed my opinion as when the package arrived, I had my doubts and it sat on my desk for a day or two before I started playing with it.\n\nI retired a few months back and we have been traveling quite a bit for cruises and road trips.  The more I travel, the more I look to condense what I carry and lighten my load.  This bag is little and yes I knew the size (in centimeters) as listed on the Amazon page.  The true measurement converted to inches is:  7 inches wide by 4.5 inches by 5.5 inches tall if stretched to capacity.  This is the total measurement of the entire bag.  Within the bag, there are two zippered compartments.  The top one has small pockets in the lid for brushes or anything you can dream up that would fit.  the measurement of this section is 7 inches wide by 4.5 inches by 1.75 inches deep.  The second (bottom) compartment is 7 inches wide by 4.5 inches by 2.75 inches deep.  When the little bag arrives, it is one flat mass of polka dots, but no worries because this sweet thing grows and can hold far more than I ever imagined.  It can be filled up with as much as you want to carry and the one thing I love about it is that if not completely full to the brim, it collapses and folds down on itself.  This to me is a plus because it saves space in my carry on bag.  I have always carried the more stiff makeup or toiletry bags, which are bulky and just take up extra room that I could have squeezed another pair of cute shoes in.  I have attached a couple pictures to give you some perspective on how much this cute little bag can hold.\n\nThere are other aspects of my new bag that I like.  There is a little mirror which is attached by a fabric tether in the top compartment for touching up on the plane or on the run. The stitching on the bag is very nice with decorative coordinating cording.  The zippers move freely and have little plastic pulls on the ends to easily grasp.  There are two zipper pulls on each section that meet in the middle for easy access.  The fabric is smooth, soft and  sturdy and the polka dot pattern is just so cute.  I chose the black and white polka dots because it coordinates with my other bags and carry on.  Another benefit to this bag is I like to travel with my essential oils an the 10 ml bottles have enough room to stand upright in the bottom zippered section.  I put three bottles in one of my photos to show an example.  My overall opinion of the bag is five stars and I am anxiously waiting on the next trip to use it some more.  Hope I have helped with the measurements in inches."],

That's why Gillette created Fusion ProGlide Silvertouch&#x2014;Gillette's gentlest shave, incredible on sensitive skin (among those with a preference, in manual and power, respectively).\nThe reengineered ProGlide Low Cutting Force Blades feature Gillette&#x2019;s thinnest, finest edges (first four blades vs. Fusion) with advanced antifriction coating to cut effortlessly through hair with less tug and pull (vs. Fusion). That means more skin comfort. A Blade Stabilizer maintains optimal blade spacing for comfort, enabling the blades to adjust to the contours of your face. A Streamlined Comfort Guard channels excess shave prep to produce optimal blade contact, stretching the skin for a close, comfortable shave. And the ProGlide Enhanced Lubrastrip is infused with mineral oil and lubricating polymers that allow the razor to move smoothly over skin, even on repeat strokes.\nRecommended by Dermatologists#1 dermatologist recommended razor for men who have sensitive skin (in manual and power, respectively).\nEnhanced LubrastripLarger than before and infused with mineral oil and lubricating polymers, enabling the razor to move smoothly over skin.\nImproved Precision TrimmerAn enhanced blade with anti-clogging rinse slots.\nReengineered Low Cutting Force BladesThinner, finer edges (first four blades vs. Fusion) and our advanced low-resistance coating cut effortlessly through hair with less tug and pull than Fusion.\nBlade StabilizerMaintains optimal blade spacing for comfort, while allowing the blades to adjust to the contours of your face.\nWhat makes Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power better than Gillette Fusion?Fusion ProGlide is Gillette's best shave. It incorporates years of technological innovation for Gillette's most advanced blade ever. Gillette Fusion ProGlide and Fusion ProGlide Power share the same core technology: thinner, finer blades (the first four blades vs. Fusion) that glide through the hair for less tug and pull (vs. Fusion), a low-resistance coating, and the Precision Trimmer Blade. In addition:\nHow long will the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razo blade last?How long a razor blade lasts depends on many variables such as beard toughness and thickness, beard preparation, shaving habits, and skin sensitivity. The Gillette Fusion ProGlide's reformulated Indicator Lubricating Strip will provide you with a visual cue - it fades to white - when optimal shave conditions have been reduced. When this happens, you may want to consider changing your razor blade to get an optimal shave.\nWhat are thinner, finer blades, and how will they improve my shave?Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power and ProGlide Manual razors have been engineered with Gillette's thinnest blades ever (the first four blades vs. Fusion), to glide through hair with less tug and pull (vs. Fusion).\nHow was the Precision Trimmer improved over the Fusion?The blade was enhanced, and anti-clogging rinse slots were added.\nWhat is the Streamlined Comfort Guard with channels, and what are its benefits?Gillette Fusion ProGlide features a Streamlined Comfort Guard. The soft, flexible material surrounds the Microfins, creating an outer edge that wraps around the sides of the cartridge and channels away excess shave prep, for optimal blade contact.\nHave there been any enhancements to the Lubrastrip?Yes. It contains more lubricants and a touch of mineral oil.\nWill the Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor blade fit any other razors on the market?The Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor blade features a new design that fits on any Gillette Fusion, Fusion Power, or Fusion ProGlide handle.",

It does things for my skin that no other serum or moisturizer that I've tried over the last 35 years has.", "I am an absolute fan of SK ii FTE. I was really skeptical at first about the claims about Pitera being an all-natural \"miracle\" ingredient. I won a sampler bottle (30ml) at a raffle and decided to give it a try. Anyway, what's one extra step in my regimen?\n\nMy skin broke out the first week I used it, which almost made me stop using it. My friend told me it's completely normal since that's my skin's way of releasing the toxins and renewing the top layer due to the reaction to the serum. As per her advice I religiously used it for another 3 weeks. I'm so glad I didn't stop, because after the initial reaction I began to see visible changes.\n\n2 weeks later my skin is significantly clearer (like 90% less blemishes), more firm, and almost glowing. The best way I can describe it is as if I'm going around all day like I just washed and toned my face. I've always had huge pores on my nose and rough spots on my jawline - now these are immensely improved. I even feel confident enough to go out without makeup.\n\nMy only complaint would be that in the weeks following when I ran out of FTE (and it took a while to buy another bottle since I was waiting for it to go on sale), I noticed my old skin problems returning. I don't know about rumors that your skin gets worse than it was before using it once you stop...for me it was just that I need to maintain a regimen or else my skin will just go back to its original state which I was not happy with. It's also quite pricey, but definitely worth every dollar. Plus you only need 3-4 drops each time, if you place it on your palm and gently pat it on. I would suggest not to use a cotton pad since most of the liquid is absorbed within and is wasted. Using your hands\/fingers also lets you massage your face and neck to get circulation going.\n\nDefinitely recommend this product - but do see a specialist if you have prolonged reactions more than 1 week.", "Purchased this product for my mom and she loves it!

The concept behind HealFast comes from the study of how the skin repairs itself. When a skin irritation occurs, the body naturally tries to rush nutrients to the problem areas so that it can heal or repair itself. The reason it takes several days to even weeks for some things to heal is because the body has only limited amounts of nutrients that can be sourced to the problem. HealFast is formulated using Ovasome Technology to source nutrients from herbal and food based ingredients. This technology provides the skin with all of the vitamins, minerals and proteins that are necessary for life. This creates a nutrient rich environment on the body that promotes healthy normal skin. Our customers have used HealFast Repair cream for the following: dry skin, cuts, burns, to prevent scarring after plastic surgery, chapped skin\/lips, sunburn, diaper rash, eczema, cradle cap, abrasions, insect bites, bed sores and more. HealFast Repair Cream is also the perfect daily moisturizer for face, neck, hands, feet and everywhere in between. The cream has exceptional penetration to provide immediate relief and visible improvement for distressed skin.

I'm an African-American female with kinky coily hair, very particular of my haircare regime. I'm not sure of my exact type, I just know my hair is the type that thrives on moisture. I never go longer than one week without cleansing my strands and sometimes I cleanse every other day. My scalp is very sensitive though with too much shampooing becomes irritated. Co-washing (using conditioner to clean my hair instead of shampoo) has become routine for me and I am constantly looking for conditioning cleansers that perform their best on my hair; maintaining moisture and not stripping natural oils. I found Pomifera Cleansing Conditioner on Amazon and decided to give it a try. Almost immediately I was hooked.  One of one of the main things that caught my attention to this product was the fact that it is Sulfate, Paraben, Gluten, & Phosphate free. Pomifera Conditioner produced teeny-tiny bubbles that seemed to help me detangle my hair as I cleansed it. I used a routine much as I would with a regular shampoo. My hair was clean, was not weighted down, and left with a nice fresh citrus smell. I ABSOLUTELY recommend this conditioner for my natural-haired divas."],

For the tall Australian tree also known as \"Long Jack\", see Flindersia xanthoxyla. Eurycoma longifolia (commonly called tongkat ali or pasak bumi) is a flowering plant in the family Simaroubaceae, native to Indonesia, Malaysia, and, to a lesser extent, Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. It is also known under the names penawar pahit, penawar bias, bedara merah, bedara putih, lempedu pahit, payong ali, tongkat baginda, muntah bumi, petala bumi (all the above Malay); bidara laut (Indonesian); babi kurus (Javanese); cy b bnh (Vietnamese) and tho nan (Laotian).Many of the common names refer to the plant's medicinal use and extreme bitterness. \"Penawar pahit\" translates simply as \"bitter charm\" or \"bitter medicine\".Older literature, such as a 1953 article in the Journal of Ecology, may cite only \"penawar pahit\" as the plant's common Malay name.",

    "reviewText": ["Maybe I don't get the point with this. Okay, they use sex to sell it; I get that. It's supposed to create a situation in which women - I'm assuming really dumb ones - are made out of control in your presence after using it. Right. And Yaks fly.\n\nBut is there anything truly unique about it?\n\nWell, it does have sandpaper sides, one of which would remove the face off a statue and other that buffs your flesh to a tender red. But other than that it's just sort of a sponge. The `directions' say it gets all those special places (if we all have them are they really so special?) but I think a washrag does a better job.\n\nSo why am I even thinking about this thing this much? I'm done and I'm outta here - to find my washcloth.", "I'm a big-time shower sponge user and have been for many years.  Whatever shower gel product I've used has worked fairly well, although I've always wished they could improve it.  Well, this Axe Detailer Shower Tool has some excellent improvements--an easy-to-grip rubber handle and this extra stiff scrubber side that gets off the tougher dirt.  Pretty good, but it's nothing THAT different from what's already out there.  Sure, it's nice and I give it three stars.  But you don't really need AXE gel for this product.  Sorry.", "Every time I mow the lawn, I get green stains on my feet, particularly the heels and toes.  I wash them off afterward, but inevitably a green caste remains over the next week.\n\nI've tried the big puffy shower things, which is really the only way to get good lather with modern liquid shower soaps and gels.  They work, and produce a lot of lather.  But, they are also hard to hold when they are soapy, are a bit scratchy, and not firm enough to really help with the green feet.  Unlike some other reviewers here, I never had a problem with how they look, though they do have a distinctly feminine air about them, even if you don't go for the pink.\n\nI was detailing my car this morning, and thought about the detailer shower tool from Axe.  I guess the clever Mad Men down in marketing got me, because I picked one up in the afternoon while I was out.  It actually does look very much like a car detailing tool, with the black and red color scheme and the \"tire\" ring around the outside edge.  It is stylized enough so that it doesn't look like something that should be decorating a mechanic's garage.  I have to admit, it does look considerably better hanging in the shower than the purple shower poof it replaced.\n\nThankfully, it is smaller than it appears in the pictures, so it is easy to hold and maneuver.  I guess because of the tire outer edge, I was worried it would be too big.\n\nThe rubber outer edge is soft, and feels like the polyurethane that inflatable pool floats are made from more than the hard rubber of a car tire.  This makes it easier to hold, but compressible so that a good lather can be worked up from the black colored shower poof inside (it is in there, hiding behind the red scrubby pad).  So already I like this better than the traditional poof, because it feels better in my hand, is easier to hold, and looks better.  But, what really threw it over the top for me is the red scrubby pad on the front.\n\nAt first I thought I would have to add soap to the red pad to use it, but the lather from the poof behind it squeezes right through it, so if you've been using the rest of the tool, the scrubby is all soaped up and ready to go.  It is perfect for getting dirt, oils, and, yes, green grass stains off of the soles of feet, toes, elbows, palms, and other tougher areas of the skin (it does tickle a bit!).  It is too rough for any other delicate regions, but the puff behind it is fine for those (that one is the same as a standard puff, and is a little bit scratchy like those are, but nothing too rough).\n\nSo, overall I really like this \"detailing tool for bodies.\"  It is easier to hold than a standard puff, looks better hanging in the shower, and has a great scrubby pad built in.  A great replacement for the standard combo of shower poof and loofah, and takes up less space. Plus, lately my wife has been asking me why my feet aren't green, which I'd say is a plus.\n\nRecommended!\n\nSean P. Logue, 2008"],

This was my first time waxing myself and it was harder than I thought. The plastic strips that the wax comes on can get slippery and it was difficult to know if the wax was at the right temperature. I guess it helps if you have experience.", "This product is very easy to use and no mess! and ripped my hair off soooo well!

Also, as time has gone by since purchased, I seem to be getting less and less shaving time per re-charge.  The old one also had an audible signal when to clean and re-charge--this one depends on you looking at the small \"signboard\" every time!

The motor on the razor sounded like it was going to go so I decided to try the quadra action because supposedly its better.  Right away I noticed that my shaves took longer using the quadra action because those small holes just took away slots and they really didn't cut anything.  I'd have to go over shaved areas again and again just to get all the stuble.  Today I just became frustrated and took out my old reflex action and voila I was done shaving in 1 minute.  This model is overpriced and not worth it. Sure you can wash it under the tap but the water causes the hair in the chamber to clump up until finally there is just a whole bunch of gunk in there thats very difficult to clean out. My old reflex action was munch better because all I had to do was open it up and the powedered hair just came out.  Save your money.  Get a reflex action instead of this.", "I recieved this shaver a week ago, and am quite impressed. It gives a close shave, or at least as close as any electric can.

    "reviewText": ["I just finished applying this product to my hair and I am very happy!  My hair is wavy and long, with some sections downright curly.  I also henna my hair about once every month to get the color I like.  I wasn't sure how this would react with henna, so I only did the underneath layer of my hair, just in case (which is also the curliest part of my hair).  The results are very shiny, healthy looking hair, with a much relaxed curl, and no effect at all on the henna hair color.  I'll be doing the top layer next, now that I see the great results.\n\nMy hair had gotten to be pretty damaged from too much heat styling, and my ends were getting fried.  I'm trying to grow out a haircut and so wanted to do something to help strengthen and protect my hair to help it grow longer - the main reason I did this treatment.  My split ends look much better now, and much less visible.  When I pull on a split end it doesn't snap as easily.  And my hair is so shiny!  All good stuff.  The curl has relaxed quite a bit, although there is still a slight wave to it, which is nice because I think I could still probably play up the wave with styling if I wanted to.  It was easier and took less effort to blow dry it straight.  Also I didn't need to use my flat iron.  I hope this helps me to not have to use so much heat styling, which can only help the health of my hair.\n\nOne piece of advice - make sure you are in a well ventilated area when you do the treatment, especially the blow drying and flat ironing part, because the fumes are no joke - my eyes burned and teared up a few times.  I had a fan blowing on me which helped.  But that was the only negative thing about this product.  Also, give yourself a couple hours to do a full application.\n\nAlthough from other reviews it sounds like it doesn't last as long as a professional treatment, for the price and the results you do get, this is a great product.\n\nUPDATE:  Although I've had great results with this product, I realized that it contains formaldehyde.  Once I use up what I have, I'll probably switch to QOD's product.  Even though QOD is expensive at first, you do get many treatments from the bottle, and from what I can tell, there isn't any formaldehyde in it.", "I have unruly curly hair and so I usually keep it very short; however I have wanted to grow it long again. The last time I grew out my hair it was a pain; between the need to flat iron it and then I finally had it chemically straighten, my hair looked like it was pasted to my head or like straw. So after some research I found this product and the reviews were mostly all good so I bought it and did it myself. Took a little time but not too long, though I will recommend having someone help with the process. It has been a week and my hair is still soft and shiny, every time I take a shower I am scared that it will go back to being curly but it hasn't so far.  I use a light leave in conditioner and let my hair dry and it has been awesome not having to spend 30+ mins on my hair each day.", "Although this product did not result in miraculously straight hair, it does cut down on frizz.  I live in the Bay Area and we have had a lot of wet, nasty fog this summer. Fog is not a curly, frizzy hair girl's friend! I have used this product twice.  It has not completely eliminated my curls.  However, when I straighten my bangs with the dryer, they stay straight.  They no longer frizz up.  So I still style my hair every day, but now my hair stays the way I style it.  I definitely will buy this product again."],

Unfortunately, none of them worked very well for me.  After 10 years of going from one brand to the next, I finally gave up, got my hormones tested, and had my doctor prescribe a compounded bioidentical formula for me.\n\nThe problem with over-the-counter progesterone is that you really don't have any precise way of knowing how much progesterone you're really getting, regardless of what the label says.\n\nI thought I was taking 40 mg. of Natra-Gest a day.  And yet, when my progesterone levels were actually checked, the pharmacist said the amount of progesterone floating around in me was almost non-existent.  Go figure.  This makes me wonder if there really is as much progesterone in over the counter creams as specified on the label.\n\nNow I'm taking 40 mgs. of compounded bioidentical progesterone cream.  At least I know how much progesterone I am really taking in.\n\nZRT Laboratories has simple saliva testing which you can order online.  You spit into a tube, send the saliva back to them, and within 2 weeks, they send back your results with suggestions.  They even give you an easy-to-understand summary about what they found.

I won't order from this source again.", "The type of dental floss most readily available in drugstores and supermarkets is the thin, round variety which breaks and shreds all too easily besides digging very uncomfortably into my thumb and forefinger.\n\nReach Dentotape by Johnson & Johnson is different. It is flat--perhaps 1\/32 of an inch wide--and stronger than ordinary dental floss. It is far less prone to break or shred between your teeth--and won't dig into fingers.\n\nThe extra width does not prevent me from getting into tight places although a little extra effort is sometimes required.\n\nOverall, this product has been very good for me. I am so glad I found it.", "I buy this dental tape from an Amazon supplier because I have trouble finding it in my local pharmacy, supermarket, etc.\nBut the shipping charges are out of line for the size of the package and its value.

I returned it after 2 shaves and bought this razor and was hooked during the first use of it. The pivoting heads easily and snugly fit the contours of your face and it gave an excellent first shave that will only get better as the blades break in over the next few weeks. The color is a bit odd and it seemed to take the hand of god to get the trimmer open but those are my only complaints.\n\n Rotary razors don't work for every type of beard but they work well for me and this is the best I have ever owned. Norelco forever!", "It gave me a razor burn sooooooooooooooo bad my girlfriend asked if Satan grabbed my face!", "Though this is one of the models in the \"lower\" groups of Norelco's offerings, it has more than enough bells and whistles.  I really can't see why anyone would need more.  My first shave with this razor ended with the best shave I have ever had in my life.  Just read on and follow all the suggested steps.\nNorelco instructs us that all razors of this model should be fully charged for 4 hours before the first shave. I believe that all of Norelco's razors are given if not a full charge, a partial charge.  The manual also explains about the LED lights that indicate the percentage of charged power available to the razor.  When I plugged my razor in for charging, before using, it said 40% available and the 60% indicator was blinking (meaning not quite 60% full).  Give the razor a full 4 hour charge, even if the LEDs say 100% in about 1 hour or so.  Go the full 4 miles the first time around (remember, this razor has a quick charge function, so it may appear to be fully charged, it isn't, it's just your quick charge at work).  I washed my face with plenty of soap and soaked my whiskers with a lot of water.  Then I dried my face completely.  Then, contrary to what Norelco says, I used a liquid preshave conditioner.  Not a gel, not a powder (which should never be done with these razors), simply a liquid.  Then I shaved - - - and it was the best shaving experience I have ever had.\nThe LED lights tell me everything I need to know - - 20%, 40%, on up to 100% power available.  It starts blinking red at 20% power left.  You can still shave; it's just letting you know that you need to charge it up.  It does have the sideburn trimmer, which I have used and it performed wonderfully for me.\nIf this is the \"lower\" line, I don't know what you can do with the higher lines.  I do not see any need for something beyond this razor.  It has its cleaning brush for the razor heads, it has its charging cord, it has its neat little traveling pouch that holds the razor and all its accessories.  What more do you need?\nIt feels comfortable and well balanced in my hand, it is very quiet, and it is a pleasant razor to look at.  For the price, you cannot possibly go wrong."],

    "reviewText": ["(Posted 27 Jan 2015)  Obviously you need to get the right parts for your shaver.  For the shaver I own, this cutter head and screen kit appear to be identical to the original parts, fit and work perfectly, making the shaver effectively new.  My shaver is marked \"Braun MobilShave M60, also appearing on the shaver: \"Type 5607, Made in China, 2009\"  An LED flashlight lighting it at an angle up close makes this easy to read.  Otherwise it's hard to see.  I understand from my research that this part kit also fits and works in some more-or-less different models.  The Braun pocket-travel shaver that uses two AA batteries has had some design changes over the years, but the basic design concept is the same.  Replacing the screen requires that you be somewhat handy and dexterous, but I didn't find it at all difficult or time-consuming.  I used a miniature screwdrive (flat) to pry off the old screen, and the new one hooked into place easily.  The cutting head is even easier to replace.  Simply pull off the old one and push on the new one.  I was tempted to give this 4 stars because of the unusual experience waiting to receive it.  Usually with Amazon I receive things in a few days.  This took 12 calendar days.  When I went to track the package in the Amazon web site (very quick and easy to do) it was immediately obvious that it was being shipped to my house from an address in China.  However, it didn't take longer than was promised when I placed the order, and there was no additional shipping charge.  (They said \"free shipping\", but obviously the seller's shipping cost is in the price they charge for the product itself.)  I don't know who or what the seller is (one might guess that it was mailed to me from the factory in China where the shaver was origninally manufactured) but I don't have any complaints.  The packaging was adequate, and it does't matter to me that it wasn't bright and glossy.  (That's for catching your attention in a store.)  I must add that I'm a HUGE FAN of this model line of Braun shavers.  I think they more-or-less may have conceived it as a second shaver just for travel (handy for a shave in an airplane, or anywhere on the fly).  I have a very fast-grwing heavy beard and have been using this as my onlly shaver every day for decades.  It's astonishing how long two AA batteries last, especially the new lithium ones.  I'm aware that replacing the whole shaver costs only a little more than the cost of replacing cutter and foil, but, from an environmental view, on principle, I prefer not to bury in a landfill a great appliance that works perfectly, and just needs a little maintenance after a number of years of daily use.", "The screen didn't really fit the razor.", "It did not fit properly it's also turn from white to grey"],

    "description": "Our black castor oil is made using traditional Jamaican methods that have been passed down for years. Hand-processed castor beans are roasted and boiled, and the oil is skimmed off until no water remains. The result is a light to dark brown, nutty-scented oil that is ideal for many uses. It is great for hair, as it is a moisturizing oil with natural reflective qualities that boosts shine. It can be used on eyelashes to encourage growth, as well as nails to encourage growth and protect from bacteria. Black castor oil can also be used to moisturize the skin and reduce the appearance of scars, stretch marks, and acne. Skin conditions such as eczema can be soothed with castor oil, as it creates a protective barrier on the skin to lock in moisture. The relaxing scent of lavender oil makes this a soothing option for massage or nighttime application.How To UseApply as desired to skin or hair. Can be brushed through hair as a detangler, used as a deep conditioner or hot oil treatment, or rubbed on skin for restorative moisture. Brush through eyelashes for improved growth and shine, or use on hands to soften cuticles and prevent fungal issues.About Us Tropic Isle Living was launched in 1992 with the conviction to bring to market a range of Jamaican herbs and herbal products that have been valued for generations for their benefits to the hair, skin and body. For over 20 years, they have specialized in making products with ingredients from Jamaica, Africa, and the Caribbean. Our products are not mass produced; they are made the traditional, hand-processed way. It is one way to preserve the natural magnetism of the products while paying homage to its legacy.",

Using all pure, natural ingredients enriched with shea butter, you can feel the difference of our unique quad-milling process. Aromatic fragrances transport you to a moment of calmness, vitality, dreamin or well-being. This 150 Gram bar is a great value, the fragrance maintains until the soap is all used up.

    "reviewText": ["Baubax Bomber was the first travel jacket I've come across and fell in love with the style and this red color. I thought the neck pillow was the selling point to me. I was skeptical about the sizing. So I emailed Baubax customer service for advice. I'm 5'4\" chest 37\". They told me the measurements on the size chart are measurements of garments, not body. I couldn't believe I had to order a XXL if that was true and they were out of that size at that time. The rep suggested to order a men's size because they have same cutting. Then the sleeve would have been way too long for me. I wasn't comfortable enough to order one since I have to pay to ship and to return if it doesn't fit. I sent another email with follow up questions but no reply for a while, like a month. At that point I started to browse around and found ScotteVest. I decided I prefer a company with more responsive and way better customer service.\n\nI bought a jacket for my husband, a hoodie for myself, and a hoodie for my daughter from ScotteVest. But I still have an eye on the Bomber. I really like the style. It looks flattering on the models. I'm on Baubax mailing list and found out they're on Kickstarter again to raise money for Version 2. But they're not making a red Bomber. I found this jacket in red on Amazon. I read the reviews and believed that a L may fit me according to descriptions from some reviewers (I usually wear M). I ordered from Amazon with Prime shipping and I can return at no shipping cost if it doesn't fit.\n\nI had such high hopes since I waited to buy this for a few months now. I received it today and it was a huge disappointment. It fits and looks ok on me when the jacket is not loaded. Jacket is heavier than similar style jackets and I don't mind the weight. However, the negatives pointed out from other reviewers are true.\n\n1. It fits tight on the upper arms even though it's one size bigger than my normal size and my arms are not fat. And it fits just right all over meaning I can't really stuff the jacket.\n\n2. There aren't as many pockets as ScotteVest and the pockets are not as practical. Front hand pockets don't have zippers and are not deep and slanted enough to store anything without worrying them to fall out. The buttoned front pocket can only hold a bag of kleenex. It's narrow and deep (my finger tips can't reach the bottom). A passport fits in the front zipper pocket just right. On the inside, there are a zipper pocket for tablet but no zippers on other pockets. My big phone (Samsung S8+) fits in the phone pocket just right. Sunglasses fits in the glasses pocket just right. I think I can store credit card and ID in the two smaller pockets but they're two small for a wallet. So I have to put my wallet in the tablet pocket. Which is fine with me because I wasn't going to carry a tablet with me.\n\n3. Neck pillow is stored in the hood is a joke. Like all other reviewers said, it's heavy and it takes up the space of the hook. So when the pillow is in the hood, the hood wouldn't fit on my head and it looks ridiculous on the back. I was excited about the neck pillow but now not so much. I didn't try to blow it up because I didn't want to do that if I plan on returning it.\n\n4. In order to put on the hood, I have to remove the neck pillow and store inside the tablet pocket with my small wallet. The hood fits but again, like other reviewers said, the flap gets in the way. And the material creates so much static that it makes my hair go crazy.\n\n5. Since I have to store the pillow in tablet pocket with my small wallet, now I look like having a tumor because it is so bulky.\n\n6. I found the use of the two inside small pocket for chapstick and hand sanitizer. They're just too small for most things.\n\n7. When I took off the loaded jacket carefully (no zippers to secure my belongings), the sunglasses slipped out the pocket.\n\nWhat I liked about Bomber is the look when it's not loaded. Unfortunately there are too many flaws of the design that needs a lot of improvements. Especially when I have comparisons with ScotteVest, it was a not brainer that Bomber is overpriced for the quality and design. I have to return it. And I won't risk my money to order the new version on Kickstarter.", "I'd seen alot of negative reviews on this item, specifically regarding size.  So I ordered a size up.

This was the million-dollar idea of Yoganshi Shah and Hiral Sanghavi. Eventually their goal is to incorporate their background of electronics and software to create smart apparel!\nConvenience on the go. That is what Yoganshi Shah thought of when her husband, Hiral Sanghavi, kept forgetting his neck pillow when he travelled.

Yoganshi had a brilliant idea of creating a jacket that essentially embodies everything has a place, and everything in its place. The outcome was a functional jacket designed for accessibility and comfort. The BauBax jacket has 15 features that helps all travelers and people on-the-go stay organized with pockets for a tablet, smart phones, sunglasses, and even a drink pocket. To add to the overall functionality, there is space to hold earphones, built-in eye mask, gloves that extend from the sleeves, and comes with a microfiber cloth to keep all eyewear sparkly clear. Of course it has the built-in neck pillow that will not be left at home again.\nYou likely never heard of a travel jacket before Baubax, but it's the jacket you always needed but never existed.\nIt is good to have clothing that solves problems you face in your day-to-day life.

The one time I did get a pedicure, the poor lady had some issues cutting my toe nails and had to get a different pair of clippers for my toe nails.  I cut my toe nails when they need clipping, usually the nail clipper may tear at the nail a bit because it cannot always get a clean cut all the way through.  In the case of the Smiley Face Clippers, they were excellent, I didn't have to worry about any tearing of the nails.\n\nThe thing I really like about these clippers is the look.  When I got them I thought that the smiley face was incidental, but then in doing the review, I checked the name and realized that was intentional.  The smiley face is not too terribly pronounced, but its amusing.  I like these clippers because they're a bit more masculine.  They are more of a stainless steel, almost industrial design.  There is a little piece of me that wishes that there was a bottle opener at one end; it almost looks like there easily could be.  I think that these are great, and are especially good if you're looking for a set for your husband, or you may want something that has less curved edges and easier to grip for bigger hands.", "Who knew that there really was a difference between nail clippers!

The outer top and bottom are lined in a nice material that is soft and smooth. Very pretty case and durable also. It opens with a push button lock mechanism. Each tool is securely stored under a strap to hold it in place. That keeps them from moving around in the case. The metal tools are all quality Stainless Steel.\n\nMy favorite tool is the Glass\/Crystal Nail File. I love these type of files. Metal and emery board files can tear and damage nails. These crystal files are gentle and slowly file your nails without damaging them. It takes a little longer but you are doing better for your nails in the long run. The tweezers are very well aligned with no gaps when you close the tips. The cuticle trimmer and scissors are sharp and both cut well. The cuticle pusher ends are smooth so you don't harm your skin. The clippers are like 3 tools in one. Great at clipping nails and also has a metal file portion on the handle. They have a pointed tip too for cleaning out under nails.\n\nThis is a great set with a nice case. Very convenient and portable. Easily fits in my purse or in my car. Very nice!\n\n***Disclosure: I received this item at a promotional discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.", "It broke within a few months of having it.

I had already bought the foaming cleanser, whipping cream cleanser, toner, and essence and adding the emulsion was a HUGE step I can see now from the difference of not using the product vs adding it on. It's a milky type of consistency and the bottle is actually bigger than I expected it to be. I also love how at the bottom of the bottle (like the essence \/ somewhere on the other products) it tells me the date presented is when it was manufactured.\n\nI can't speak Korean so that little paper was a huge help haha. Though, it still says the order is \"on it's way.\"", "I'm usually very skeptical of beauty products that seem to promise the earth, however I am becoming a huge fan of Etude House products and the Wonder Pore collection.\n\nCompared to the prices of similar products from other companies, Etude always has very reasonable prices - especially when you consider that even a small amount of the clay goes a long way. One very thin layer is plenty to get results! I usually use this one to two times a week, and it really feels like I'm pampering myself. The peppermint leaves my skin tingling, and after the mask is washed away my skin looks brighter, tighter, and the blackheads around my nose area are gone\/much less visible.\n\nAt the very least, I would recommend anyone looking at this product to try it at least once. Even if you don't want to incorporate it regularly into your beauty routine, it's something fun to do for a staying-in girl's night with your friends!"],

You're welcome in advance btw this took like 30 minutes.\n\nIf you are looking for a pomade to get a nice clean cut look(I have thick straight hair that I part on the left side and comb to the right, Blonde) seriously look elsewhere. I heard Jon Hamm and Dicaprio wear this, that is complete and utter bull.

It was very thick and not at all what I was looking for...so into the trash it went.", "Im going to keep this short. This pomade does not work for me, the experience was terrible. I was working on my hair for 30 min this morning because this Pomade was too heavy and it flattened my hair. After seeing that I was going to be late I grudgingly left for work. I used about a quarter size glob of it, I put my index finger in and stuck it in about half a nail deep and scooped it up. The consistence is like uh...hot glue I guess. I had to really rub it in my hands to get it to melt enough to apply. I applied it on a towel dried hair. It made most of my hair flat, and some little spikes that formed around my cowlick did not stay down. I do have to say it held very very well. But its over kill in my opinion. Heres a example, today I went to cardio kickboxing class and sweated like a mule. I came out of there with my hair still the same looking. All that sweat did nothing to phase my hairdo. Now all of this stuff is forgivable, what really did it in for me is how hard this stuff is to wash out. I know you all hear of how bad Murray's is to wash but let me tell you exactly how bad it is. The internet downplays it in a joking manner, I am not amused. I washed my hair 5 times in the shower with 2 Shampoo's scrubbing and massaging vigorously; to no avail. So I took my soap bar and tried that, did not work. I then tried conditioner thinking maybe it would soften my hair but that didn't work either. After towel drying my hair, I can still sculpt it, like if I just applied hair spray. I am not sure why anyone would want a product that is so bloody hard to remove I don't look forward to putting my greasy waxy hair on my pillow. What is worse the Murrays that DID wash out ended up on my face, so even after washing my face 2 times with a scrub I still have a waxy layer on my cheek and forehead area.\n\nSo in conclusion, yeah this stuff is not for me. I think I might try Vitali's or Groom&Clean next as they are water based and easier to wash out. I give it 3 stars because the product works. What everyone says is true this stuff is second only to Gorilla Glue. Its just not for me, if I rated on personal experience I would give it a 1 star. I plan on giving the remaining Murray's to a co worker as a gag joke. If I am going to have this crud in my hair for a week I might as well have someone to share my agony with."],

The 8831xl gets 5\/5 stars.  You can always return any Norelco shaver within 2 months for a full refund, so get your hands on any Norelco Spectra shaver ASAP!\nAfter buying the 8825, I found the 8831 on eBay and I called Norelco and asked what this unlisted model was all about.  They said it's a special model that they only sell to certain department stores, like Macy's, every now and then.  Anyway, the 8825 has only 45 mins of shaving time while the 8831 has 70 mins.  The 8831 package also includes a CAR CHARGER.  And thirdly, the 8831 is pearly white, not blue like the 8825.  Other than these three differences, THAT'S IT, no other differences whatsoever.  Oh wait, there is just one more difference... the price!  The 8825, which is Norelco's entry-level Spectra model, sells for over $100.  The 8831 sells on Ebay for about $60 shipped.  One of Norelco's top-of-the-line shavers for WAY under $100, are you kiddin?!  Nope, it's an absolute steal.  You might be wondering if I own both shavers now... nope!  I bought this 8825 first but then returned it to Norelco within 60 days for a full refund and then bought the 8831 on Ebay brand new for about $60 shipped.\nThe 8825 was my first electric shaver ever, and I really did need Norelco's recommended 3 weeks for my hair to get used to electric shaving.  By the way, all of the Spectra models shave the same, as they don't differ with their blades.  It's just that the higher models like 8890 and 8894 have fancy displays and bells and whistles, none of which make for a better shave than the 8825 or 8831.  Anyway, I was using Mach 3 razors for the past few years.  The Mach 3 was great for my face, but I rarely could ever get a close AND comfortable shave on my neck without irritating it and getting red bumps, and I could never comfortably shave every morning, it always had to be at least every 36 hours or every other day.  But with my new Norelco Spectra, now I can shave every morning without ANY irritation and I can also comfortably shave my neck CLOSER than a blade now.  Sixty bucks to feel like a million.  I'd say that's not a bad deal.  What do you think?", "I just got my first Norelco model 8825 XL, after 7 years using a Braun 4501. I considered these two brands the top in the electrical shaving industry. In some aspects I founded the Norelco reigning over the Braun and in other aspects the Braun is much better. So, the question you should ask yourself is what type of hair are you trying to shave?\nLet first look at the Norelco series:\nThe different between the Norelco's Spectra (8000 series), Quadra (7000 series), Advantage (6000 series), and the Reflex (5000 series) is one major feature added to each series. The Reflex sports the basic \"Lift & Cut\" system. The Advantage is the same but include a lotion dispenser. The Quadra's \"Lift and Cut\" system has two types of head with a slot and hole. The Spectra series has what the Quadra does, but include a comfort control. Both the Quadra and Spectra don't have lotion dispenser. There are also more special features that can be found in each series by looking at the 2nd digit. For example the Spectra 8894 have a digital screen where the bare-bone lower number Spectra 8825 have just a green light.\nThe performances, Norelco vs. Braun:\nI have soft hair in the beard area and thicker hair around the lips (mustache and chin area). The Norelco does a superior job in the beard area; it cut it clean with a couple of strokes. When using the Braun (older model 4501), I sometime have to use a long trimmer and then go back over with the coil. The Norelco three individual heads move over the sides of the face a lot better. Braun does do a superior job over the mustache area. It coils has more and bigger holes then Norelco. The Spectra with it dual slot and hole head is good but takes longer time to cut down the thicker stub. The old Braun battery (NH-) is dying on me. Norelco battery (NiCd) is replaceable and you use it charged or just plug and play, which the Braun could not do. Overall, I prefer the Norelco's design.\nThe features I like:\nI am still playing with the Personal Comfort Control and am not sure if it is necessary. The more sensitive the level is the long it takes to cut so far. The long hair trimmer is great, but that is almost standard in most models, but not the Advantage's Series. Plug and play is great, since I don't travel every day. Cleaning is simple; just rinse it in the sink. I like the solid construction the Norelco's design is, the rotating machine is fun to use and is very smooth.", "I am very happy with the close shave from this shaver, my previous shaver was a Braun and this gives me a closer shave in less time. It is also very quiet in operation.\n\nMy only knock is that the owners manual says that the charger needs to be unpluged after charging is complete.  This is quite inconvient."],

    "description": "The Spectra Shaving System is Norelco's newest most innovative dry shaving technology for superior shaving performance.\nUsers switching from another dry electric razor to the Spectra will notice the difference at first shave. A plethora of features contribute to the comfortable shave that this model of the Spectra provides. First, there are three round floating heads that rotate in multiple directions to move with the contours of your face, and align the blades closer to your skin for a smoother shave. Each razor head offers two stages of cutting: slots to tackle the longer hairs and round holes to cut the stubble. Equipped with Norelcos Lift &amp; Cut technology, the blades even cut below skin level so not a hint of stubble is left on the face. Using the comfort control dial along the side of the shaver, users can personalize their shave by choosing from nine different settings to accommodate all skin conditions from normal to sensitive. For men with beards, sideburns, or mustaches, a full-width pop-up trimmer flips up on the back of the Spectra for specialized grooming. When shaving is complete, the Spectra simply rinses clean under the water tap. This rechargeable cordless razor is ideal for travelers, automatically adjusting to any voltage throughout the world, from 100V to 240V. Just one hour of charging on the included cord produces 45 minutes of uninterrupted shaving time, and a 6-minute quick-charge feature is helpful for sneaking a fast 3-minute shave. Battery indicators show when the razor is fully charged and when recharging is necessary. The 8825XL includes a storage pouch for travel, a coil cord, a protective cap for the razor head, and a cleaning brush. Norelco offers a 60-day money-back guarantee on this shaver in addition to a two-year warranty. --Cristina Vaamonde",

    "description": "How to Use   Apply nail polish on your nails and wait until completely dry. We recommend using fast dry top coat over nail polish or bare nails to create a flat surface which helps the product stick better. Make sure nail is dry and free of oily residues before applying product.   Lightly push tape\/stencils to the nail using a finger, especially paying attention to the areas near skin, cuticles, and the tips of long nails. You can always cut nail tape to size if they are too long and cut stencils to help them form better to the tip, sides and curvature of the nail. Try peeling stencils from different directions if you have trouble with smaller pieces not remaining on the backing paper. Find your direction and peel fast, holding stencil close the backing sheet. When small pieces remain within a stencil, flip and stick\/peel the stencil to the back of the paper to remove all stuck pieces.  Apply fresh or thinned, not thick or gloopy, nail polish across the tape\/stencil. Shimmer and metallic nail polishes work better than cremes. We recommend applying nail polish with a sponge lightly pushing it to your nail, similar to ombre design, this prevents any polish bleeding under the stencil giving cleaner lines. Remove extra nail polish from your skin and cuticles by using a flat brush dipped in acetone or nail polish remover.  Remove tape\/stencils immediately after applying nail polish using your fingers, tweezers or nippers while the polish is still wet. For better results pull the tape following its edges and stencils following the pattern.   Wait until your design has completely dried before applying top coat. Use fresh or thinned top coat, hold your brush parallel to your nail and try not to touch a nail with the brush, only the top coat drop should touch the nail to prevent smearing.  ",

The molecular structure causes any liquid to become more hydratious, taste better and extend shelf life. Placed in a fridge, the Nano Wand's energy frequency permeates the fridge; all liquids, meat and fruit will taste better and have extended shelf life. The renewed molecular chains are similar to those found in healthy natural spring water. Like fruit and vegetables, the body slowly also loses molecular chains as we age. They can be re-energized at a molecular level to provide energy, using the Nano Wand. The hydratious nature of water is important to wellness. Molecular structured water carries improved oxygen flow to the blood, assists in detoxification of free radicals, improves liver detoxification, and improves nutrient take up by the body.

I have multi toxic exposures and these products are the best for ridding the body from harmful chemicals and poisions. I got burned in a whirlpool and using both products on my burns have been amazing \"the results are undescribable and unbelievable\".

Prior to this, I used Alaffia shea butter, which is fairly traded, raw, and unrefined, but cost $15 for 2 ounces.  This was $15 for 2.3lbs!!  Of course, alaffia's shea butter has a REALLY nice texture - it wasn't sticky at all once warmed between the hands - and unscented (or I should say mildly shea butter scented).\n\nThis product, I noticed, it a bit sticky and has a smoky scent that isn't unpleasant - just smoky.  The smell does dissipate after a few minutes, although after my workouts my skin tends to heat up and I can kind of smell the shea butter again on my skin. The important thing is that it does keep your skin moisturized and it is very inexpensive.\n\nFyi... the product arrives wrapped in plastic in the form of a big yellow shea butter brick, so make sure you have a container to put it in.", "I see the price has gone up a little since I bought this only two weeks ago.  But it's still a great price if you're like me, having spent around $10 for 4 oz. (at a health food store) of a white variety that also was raw, unrefined -nothing added.  But the white shea butter has no scent or very, very little.  This shea butter is yellow as the picture shows with a smell that is very much like cocoa butter, not at all unpleasant.

After that time the healing properties of Shea butter are less effective but it is still a good moisturizer.\n\n \n\nApplication of the Shea Butter\n\nShea butter melts at body temperature. For easy application warm Shea butter onto palms until it is completely melted and smooth on. Shea Butter absorbs quickly, penetrates deeply and coats the skin with a fine film; thereby diminishing water loss and leaving the skin softened and protected.\n\nThe Amazing Properties of Shea Butter\n\n\nShea butter is the best natural product to protect, heal and improve skin. It is prized\n\nbecause it contains a real cocktail of elements good for the skin. Among these, is first a\n\nvery high content of Essential Fatty Acids, more than in all other vegetable butter. These\n\nfatty acids are oleic, stearic, linoleic and palmitic acid.\n\n\n\nThey play a very important moisturizing, softening, and anti-inflammatory role, and help\n\nrenew the cutaneous cells. Shea butter also contains vitamins A, D, E, and K that have a\n\nrecognized effect against skin aging. It is also rich in phytosterols with protecting and\n\nregenerating virtues.\n\n\nThe manufacturing process has a great influence on the properties and efficiency of\n\nShea butter. If it is refined or processed, it loses its vitamins and part of its efficiency.\n\n The Organic Shea Butter Company brings you a handmade certified organic Shea butter\n\nthat is a guarantee of purity and higher quality.",

An amazing and graceful way to start the day. Why use a tongue cleanser? Our tongues are almost a third of the surface area of our mouth. They are a rich surface of papillae that has been likened to a deep-pile carpet. That makes them an excellent trap for decaying food debris and bacteria. Medical evidence shows that this environment can create bad breath, plaque and dental decay, as well as reduce taste sensitivity. Toothbrushes and mouthwashes simply cannot remove bacteria as effectively or safely as tongue cleansers. Using a tongue cleaner will: - reduce bad breath - reduce plaque formation - reduce tooth decay - refresh the palate, enabling taste buds to function more effectively Why Amano? The Italian-crafted Amano Tongue Cleanser has been designed to give a superior tongue cleansing performance. The head is made of 18\/10 Austenitic Steel  a high-grade chromium and nickel alloy. Because of the precise design and weight, there is NO GAG affect! And unlike a plastic tongue cleanser, which needs to be regularly replaced, an Amano Tongue Cleanser will last for years to come.",

The Cool Shave seemed like a great product because you can use it in the shower, or out as long as your face is wet. This razor is a big step up. It gives me a much less irritating shave than the dry one. I bought the one with all of the warning lights, like charging, how much time until charging ends, indicators, and how much shave time left. I hardly look at any of them except the shave time and charging time. Also, I don't use the Nivea pouches anymore. They are a good idea, but they run out too fast and are expensive. I use the Gilette blue shaving lotion. I put it all over my face and wet the razor. It is just as effective. Also, the razor doesn't come with a sideburn function attached. You have to put it on separately (but it is included), which is only a minor pain. I can deal with it. Some people have written that the razor is a bit slippery, which is true, but mine has never fallen out of my hands. The zipper case is nice, but kind of small. So, overall, the extra touches don't mean much. It is the razor that is, itself, the best part. The shave is smooth and very close. It feels nice to use a battery-powered razor on a wet face.

Blade razors, like Mach 3, give better shaves but they usually leave cuts on my face so this was the best thing. I like the quick 1-hour charge a lot.  The shaving time is actually shortened for me because I just do it during the shower.  Nevertheless, the shaver at $120 is not cheap.  Like others said, Nivea cartridges can run out fast.  But I found a remedy- Nivea \"after shave balm\" 3.3 oz. at $4.79 in a local CVS pharmacy or Walmart gives you the same quality  as little five Nivea 0.4 oz. cartridges(total 2 oz.) at $5 do.

The Cool Skin Razor dispenses Nivea for Men Shaving Lotion or Gel that sets your beard up for an unexpectedly close and comfortable wet shave, leaving your face feeling smooth and refreshed.\nThe Norelco 7775X CoolSkin Lotion Dispensing Razor features a built-in lotion system that dispenses Nivea for Men shaving gel or lotion. This revolutionary, integrated system combines the advanced technology of Norelco's Reflex Action Glide Rings and the skin-nourishing benefits of Nivea for Men for a remarkably close, comfortable shave without the irritation of a blade.\n   Guide rings spread and hold gel.

Designed to be used in or out of the shower, the 7775X provides an unparalleled, refreshing shave experience and the ultimate in versatility. A simple push of the button dispenses just the right amount of Nivea for Men lotion or gel onto the shaving head, and the patented Glide Rings then distribute the lotion evenly, keeping in constant contact with the skin. The lotion and gel are vitamin enriched to moisturize and the alcohol-free formulas will not dry or irritate the skin. This process allows whiskers to soften, resulting in a less irritating, more soothing shave.\nThe CoolSkin also features Norelco's signature floating head design that continuously adjusts to the contours of the face. The design also integrates improved \"Lift and Cut\" technology for the ultimate in closeness. With stainless steel blades, Norelco's dual blade system gently lifts hair to cut below the skin level. And the raised head design is easily washable via a quick cleaning system that allows for easy flow-through when cleaning under a faucet -- simply rinse the razor under your faucet after each use for a clean, fresh shave time-after-time.\nFor safe, easy use in the shower, Norelco designed the 7775X with an anti-slip grip for convenient handling, wet or dry. The hair collection chamber captures shaven hairs for easy post-shave clean-up, and the full width click-on trimmer attachment defines and shapes mustache and sideburns. The razor charges quickly in just one hour, and a full charge delivers 40 minutes of shaving time. Plus, an advanced multifunction color LED display indicates battery level (when the battery is low, full or needs recharging), when to replace\/clean the heads, and when to use lotion\/gel.

I have extremely sensitive skin (it took me years of working with dermatologists to find ONE cleanser and ONE moisturizer that don't break me out). I pour a small amount into a tiny kids medicine cup, apply to skin with small eye shadow brush, leave on as long as possible (sometimes it tingles slightly, sometimes it burns pretty intensely), then I neutralize with baking powder before cleansing my skin as usual. I typically add a heavier moisturizer or aloe vera from my garden to soothe the skin afterward (before baking soda trick, I burnt a patch of skin and it was nasty red for days and peeled). It usually leaves my skin very red for up to a few hours, but once I figured out the baking soda and aloe vera combo it hasn't been a problem at all. The treatment helps even out skin tone, shrink pores, prevent break outs, and reduce wrinkles.

With ingredients such as honey, coconut, avocado, and macadamia nut oils, along with mango and cocoa butter, you know that this body butter is super creamy and luxurious.  At a very generous 8.8 ounces, the container is huge and will last such a long time.  The top listed ingredient is water and it definitely brings the moisture to your skin.

It did not leave my skin oily at all nor did I feel like I needed to re-apply it. I also avoid lotions that are potent with scents.  It makes me wonder how much of the lotion is actually good for your skin... I wouldn't dump perfume on my skin. This had a very light scent to it.  It is a sweet scent and I like it.

The one thing to note on this mask is that the cleanser has a high PH, so you might want to skip this step and use your own cleanser, especially if you are sensitive to high PH cleansers.\nI will certainly purchase this mask in the future.\n\nI did receive this item at a discount for my honest review.", "Great product to keep your skin hydrated! and revitalized!

It transforms your skin into that dewy skin full of youth and vibrancy the next day.\n\nI have never had trouble with my skin, but as I have gotten older, I started developing adult eczema, and skin experts said it was caused due to imbalance in the amount of water and oil in my skin besides the stress and other disruptors caused by the environment. Long story short, however, I always find my skin completely hydrated and younger looking after each use of the mask and all the great creams that come with the pack. Seriously, neck cream?!

Using all pure, natural ingredients enriched with shea butter, you can feel the difference of our unique quad-milling process. Aromatic fragrances transport you to a moment of calmness, vitality, dreamin or well-being. This 150 Gram bar is a great value, the fragrance maintains until the soap is all used up.

That's when I realized how helpful it could be for my hands in the winter when they become incredibly dry and cracked, sometimes to the point of bleeding. I also found it to be my favorite lip treatment.\n\nThe primary drawback? It's very, very greasy. I know that's almost an necessity when it comes to dry skin treatment. But rubbing it in can be a mess. I find myself wanting to use it, but having to wait because I know I need to be on the computer or doing other things with my hands.\n\nAnd that is where this particular packaging of Aquaphor comes in very, very handy.\n\nThis 3 oz tube has a foam tip applicator instead of the normal lotion lid. Once you squeeze some of the ointment on your skin, the foam tip can be easily and comfortably used to rub in the ointment without having to use your hands! In fact, the applicator is so effective that I have been able to reduce the amount of ointment I use because it massages the ointment into my skin much more effectively than my fingers can.\n\nI have used this applicator on smooth stretches of skin such a legs or torso. But, I've also used it to work the ointment into extremely dry patches between my fingers. It worked beautifully in all situations.\n\nI will say that the foam applicator takes some getting used to as far as how much ointment to use. It's easy to get too much, especially if you're used to using Aquaphor. And, it doesn't pull back into the tube if you over-squeeze. It just gets caught in the foam. So, go light - you can always squeeze out more!", "My 6 year old son had this strange habit of licking his bottom lip.  Sometimes he can lick it so much throughout the day that his bottom lip becomes red, raw, and dry.  This is the type of situation in which you would use Aquaphor Healing Ointment.  First off, it's going to protect the raw area from the elements.  And in my son's case, it's going to protect his skin from his tongue.  Yes it's petroleum based, but that is one of the great things petroleum is great for.  That was what we were using prior.

Lets see 5x12=60 Thats a new shaver a year. Heres what I do...and not out of cheapness either, after every shave pop the screen off and give it and the blades one good blow, pop screen back on. Every other time, clean it.\nEvery 6th time charge it. By blowing every shave and cleaning every other....... you get 90 days out of a fluid refill, not 30.\nThe base detects how much [stuff] is in the fluid, and when it gets too much ,forces you to change cartridges or it will not work.(clean) To make your batteries last an extra year.. once a month let them run down completely, then charge. Theres a difference between being cheap and throwing money away. I just get to buy more toys. Aint that whats its about? Closest shave ever? Not really, but fuctional enough to be worth it. Overall> Nice shaver.\n\nUPDATE: Sept 16, 2012.  This unit lasted me six years then took a dump.", "I bought the 6520, which is basically the same model as this unit according to Consumer Reports, just discontinued. They gave an excellent rating to both models. They also gave an excellent rating to the higher end Norelco's.\nI haven't used an electric shaver for over 10 years as I was not impressed with their closeness back then (I owned a Braun then too). But, after getting sick of razor burn here and there in the summer or having my face get dry as hell after shaving with a blade in the winter, I decided to give them another try. I also like to have a clean shaven face on the weekends when I don't feel like taking a shower.\nI guess things have changed because this thing shaves pretty close to a blade! No, an electric shaver will never cut as close as a blade so if that's what you really like then this may not be for you. However, the technology is definitely improving.\nThis model does a great job of shaving very close on the flatter expanses of my face, like my cheeks, but a little less so around my chin area. Also, my hair is not thick and burly like some guys, but by no means is my facial hair sparse (I'm a white Italian-Irish mutt). I prefer this style shaver over the Norelco. I never liked the Norelco system and you have to replace those blades every year at the cost of about [$$$]. These should last 18 months and you could probably get along just fine for 2 years if you have a thinner beard. The blade replacement on these is about [$$$].\nIf you want a quick and decent shave that you can even do in the car on the way to work, then this a great option. The battery is strong and you can get at least 4 shaves on one charge. I hear the high-end Panasonic 8003 or something is great but it cost [$$$] and using some kind of shaving cream is recommended with its use.  What's the point? I'm using this thing for convenience.  [Heck], if I have to do that just give me the [darn] blade.\nI bought this sucker new on Ebay for [$$$] so I can't complain. You might be able to find a deal on one too.", "I gave this razor to my boyfriend for his birthday.  He had been wary of using an electric razor, and has been using the Mach3 razors for the last couple of years.  However, he really loves this razor and uses it more than 50% of the time now; it not only gives a great close shave, but it also saves a lot of time.  I recommend it to anyone."],

Razor bumps and ingrown hairs occur when the removed hair grows back into the skin, causing inflammation, pain and tiny bumps in the area where the hair was removed. Ingrown hairs are a common condition that results from hair removal. It's most prevalent in black men who shave facial hair. But ingrown hairs can affect anyone with tightly curled hair who shaves, tweezes or waxes to remove hair. Ingrown Hairs also occur when the hair is weak and too thin not having the ability to break through the surface of the skin. Use product sparingly to start and increase use as needed.

These are exactly the same and an absolute steal at the price the company is asking.\n\nThe box comes with 8 wraps and envelopes with the mix and bandages. There is a little DIY to this whole process. You have to soak the bandages it comes with in boiling water for 10-15 minutes and stir the powder in the envelopes until it forms a paste. Once you have achieved the desired consistency  you paint the mix onto your skin where you are going to place the bandages. It is fairly simple. You leave it on for 45-60 minutes for maximum results. Then take a shower and wash off!\n\nYou have to reuse the bandages the box provides. You can machine wash them or hand wash them and hang dry to prevent shrinkage. I was able to use all the bandages and I am a fairly large girl. They covered my body just fine.\n\nThe wraps work well and provided a toned look to my physique. It is almost like wearing SPANX but without the SPANX! I did these wraps before I went out for the night in a little dress and I looked a few pounds lighter. The box lets you know to use these for six weeks straight and then once a month for maintenance. Overall, they are totally worth the price you are paying for the novelty and the fact that these DO work. 5\/5 stars!\n\nIf you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

I noticed that about 6 hours or so after applying it, my lips were so dry that they were starting to peel...

Bling Art Polished Finish: This range of false nails are designed for those of us who want polished nails but just dont have the time to spend making it happen. This nail is made by adding a polish layer to a base nail coat. We finish by adding a UV top coating to protect against scratches and help maintain the shine.

Bling Art Long Length: These nails are slightly longer than our other nail shapes and will give you a classy designer look no other nail shape can compete with. This nail shape will also help make your fingers appear thinner and can easily be filed to give you the sharp Stiletto Nail look.

It also contains patented active and microencapsulation scent technology that provides wetness and odor protection.\nWhy do we perspire?Sweating is your body's way of cooling itself by releasing excess heat. Therefore, while sweating is natural under any condition, it can be intensified for any number of reasons, including warm weather, exercise and stress.\nWhat's antiperspirant?Antiperspirants help block the flow of sweat from sweat glands to reduce wetness. In addition, because perspiration stimulates odor-causing bacteria, antiperspirants also reduce body odor, with scented antiperspirants fighting odor even more.\nHow do antiperspirants work?Antiperspirants use sweat against itself. Once applied, the antiperspirant is dissolved by sweat, and the dissolved particles form superficial plugs just below the skins surface. These plugs help block the release of perspiration. Generally, the plugs stay in place for about 24 hours and wash away over time.\nIf sweating is natural, is there any danger in preventing it?Actually, no. Antiperspirants are designed for usage in your underarm only. Since you have sweat glands all over your body, controlling underarm perspiration has virtually no effect on your bodys ability to cool itself.\nWhat are the varieties of Gillette Clear Gel With Power Beads?Gillette Clear Gel With Power Beads is available in Cool Wave and Power Rush scents.",

Believe me, I've tried them all", "It is a very gentle cleanser leaving skin smooth and refresh. Does not leave skin feeling dry.", "Kind of long but definitely worth reading before you buy! I almost didn't use this cleanser & that would have been a huge mistake. I received it in a trial size with Vertere's Dramatic Transformation Cream & was so focused on the cream I didn't even try the cleanser. I figured it was just a cleanser & kept using my Glycolic cleanser that I loved. About 2 months after I started to use the cream I actually took the time to read the info about this cleanser. It was a definite smack myself in the forehead moment. It's far from \"just a cleanser\" as I originally thought. It's a cleanser & serum in 1! This brand is based on having minimal steps & not needing to layer products so I should have known the cleanser had something special to it. As you cleanse your skin soaks up the lactic acid & other great ingredients. My skin had already shown significant changes from using Vertere's Cream...now after using the cleanser too I've seen even more. I use this cleanser in the morning & another at night - just from 1x per day I've definitely noticed improvement. My acne scarring is starting to lighten, I've had less breakouts, & in some areas my pores seem a little smaller. This cleanser is different then any other cleanser I've ever used - it has the consistency of a serum, it doesn't foam up, create suds, or honestly even seem like a cleanser when you are using it. But then you rinse your face w\/hot water & find your skin is so soft, it doesn't feel dry like with almost every other cleanser, & if you use their whole line all that's left is to put a tiny amount of their Dramatic Transformation Cream. No toner, no serum, no 5 layers of products...just this cleanser & the cream (& they just came out with an eye cream too!) & I just have to point out that I have been searching for \"the\" products for years now. I've tried several skincare lines, but found nothing that made enough of a difference that it was worth buying again. I always have just finished using it then ordered something different (unless it was horrible & then of course I tossed it). Well...I have finally found \"the ones\"! Vertere is amazing. (After all the products I've tried I thought I would always be settling or I'd be using 10 products to get the results I wanted. I never thought I'd call any skincare product amazing.) I can honestly say this is it, I've found it!! No more searching. Both the cleanser & the cream will stay a part of my routine - really they will be my routine since the whole principal is not to have to layer or use several products! Vertere products are a little pricey but sooo worth it. I hope this helps you decide. I can honestly say I have never written a review for a skincare product before - wasn't worth my time but Vertere's products are that good - it feels wrong not to tell everyone just how good."],

    "description": "Vertere Skin Care Refining Treatment Cleanser effectively addresses a significant challenge. Typically, cleansers designed to help improve the appearance of acne strip the skin of precious moisture which aggravates blemishes and wrinkles. Many cleansers designed for mature skins are often too rich for oilier and combination skins - especially those still experiencing breakouts. Refining Treatment Cleanser is an exceptional composition that strikes that elusive balance. Skin is left firm and soft with lines visibly diminished while improving the appearance of blemishes. Skin appears airbrushed. True to our multitasking ethos, Refining Treatment Cleanser also removes non-waterproof eye makeup. Use morning and evening to cleanse the skin without stripping vital moisture. Massage four pumps of cleanser onto damp skin in circular motions. To remove light, non-waterproof eye makeup, massage cleanser over closed eyes for ten seconds. Rinse face with tepid water; pat dry.",

I am a big believer in freshening up my skin with peeling products, both of the physical and chemical variety.  Over the years I have tried many different types and they all contain some sort of rough, gritty substance to mechanically rub off the top layer of the skin.  One of my peeling products has sharp fragments of pulverized apricot shells, another crushed salt, and my latest relies on sugar particles.\n\nI have never seen anything like this gel.  It is completely smooth and yet, after a few minutes of massage, chunks of dead skin ball up and come away. I find that rinsing with water is not enough to remove all the residual cell debris, so I use a facecloth or a sponge.  My face emerges refreshed and smoother than I thought possible with pores visibly tightened.  My sensitive skin loves this product and I have never had any undesirable side effects.  It's the sort of thing I can use before a night out, followed by makeup, or simply to prepare my skin for serum and moisturizer at night.\n\nThe modern, sleek container is really high-end and beautiful to have sitting on my bathroom shelf and, at the rate it's going, the 50 ml (1.69 oz) contents should last at least a month with regular twice-weekly use.\n\nI always look at the ingredients before putting anything on my skin, and the list here is full of most reassuringly natural extracts:  camellia leaves, sea salt, aloe vera, argan oil, orange peel, papaya, pomegranate, cucumber and Dunaliella (a micro-algae found in sea fields).  As with other Simon & Tom formulations, there is an equally long list of artificial and toxic ingredients that are NOT included.

I will say that the blade is still closer, but you get 95% there without the mess or skin irritation.  The biggest advantage is that you never have to clean or oil it manually.  Just drop it into the Clean & Charge base and forget about it.  It is always clean and ready to go!  This unit also has the longest charge-hold that I've ever seen.  I only need 3-4 minutes to shave each day, so the shaver only has to charge about once every 2 weeks!  There is one drawback that I have found:  The unavailability of the cleaning cartridges.  Hardly anyone carries this little cartridge.  I visited the large retailers in my areaincluding Wal-Mart, Target, and K-Mart and no one carries it.  A Target employee said they did carry them, but wouldn't be stocking them anymore.  I would hate to have to buy them directly from Braun.", "I always used either Braun shavers or blades. The blades were a hassle and the electrics didn't cut it, when I hadn't shaved for a few days. I also never liked cordless shavers. Had one and it just didn't feel as 'strong'. The batteries were always weak. This one has all of the above fixed. I don't even remember anynmore where I've put my blades the last time. The batteries last for more then a week of daily shaving, and it runs at full power until the last minute. The display tells you exactly how much shaving time you have left (and it is accurate). The cleaning feature is just the best. No need to use brushes anymore and it always feels fresh and smooth. It even cuts through a long weekend beard with ease. I love it. Some reviewers complained about the bad supply of cartridges. I just ordered mine right here and they are in stock. If you don't clean it every day, but only every other then the cartridge lasts for more then two month.  Compare that with the cost for the overpriced Mach3 blades.", "I have had them all but this one is the best! it really shaves close and the cleaning system is great,the only negetive thing is those darn cleaning cartridge is so hard to find,heck everybodys out of them. you may not want to try this at home but this is what I did,I filled the cartridge up with rubbing alcohol,It works great seeing that the cleaning solution has alcohol in it,what the hey! it works,sorry Braun!"],

I felt the addition of the plastic eyebrow templates cheapened it even more.  A mirror could have easily occupied that space.  The tweezers are too small and cheaply made, not something of great use in getting a great eyebrow shape.  They didn't pick up any fine hairs.  The brow brush, effectively does the job, but feels flimsy and again small for adult fingers.  The application brush again small, but at least it has a good angle and can get a fairly decent sharp line with it.  The pigments are ok, they do the job.  You get 3 different shades, so you can pretty much match any brow in the spectrum of dark, medium or light, depending on which palette you choose.  The case has a magnetic closure, which is handy, however it still leaves your brow colors exposed, if you should drop it or somehow break one you are going to end up with one heck of a mess inside a makeup bag.  The bonus scissors are handy, they are stiff, nothing that a drop of cuticle oil doesn't fix though, and do the job fairly well of trimming strays.

Red and bleeding gums are common symptoms of gingivitis. If left untreated, gingivitis can progress to periodontitis, a more advanced form of gum disease that affects the tissues that surround and support the teeth. Periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. That is why fighting plaque is an important part of a life-long oral care routine.\n \nQuestion:Are there ways to help prevent plaque build-up on my teeth?\nAnswer:Yes, there are tactics that address how to get rid of plaque and actions you can take at home to help prevent plaque formation. Make sure you receive a professional cleaning every 6 months, or more frequently as recommended by your dentist or hygienist. Also, use products specially developed to help prevent plaque, such as the Crest&#174; Pro-Health&#174; Plaque Control collection. This collection of products includes Crest Pro-Health Clinical Plaque Control Toothpaste, Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse, Oral-B&#174; Pro-Health Clinical Pro-Flex&#8482; Toothbrush and Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Clinical Protection Floss, that when used together, help keep plaque from coming back.

    "reviewText": ["But now I'm not, for sure. I have tough skin, so shaving with a razor never left cuts for me. But it was a mixed blessing, because shaving with a razor, indeed, caused a rather bad acne problem until I switched to waxing for almost two years.\n\nWaxing was great, but a pain to preform -- So I finally decided to spend my birthday money on an electric razor. All my friends insisted I'd regret it, and that they don't work. The whole usual spiel about getting a rash, and just wasting my money. But being the stubborn person I am, I had to find out for myself.\n\nAs usual, my friends were full of it.\n\nFirst of all, not only do I not get acne with an electric razor, *but* I never got any rashes or irriation, even during the first week I used it. I have dark, black facial hair, that is somewhat thinned out due to the waxing. But they're also hard and 'fine'.\n\nThe electric, no, isn't literally as close as a true hand razor. But it's close enough for the conveniance -- It's quicker than a blade for me, and easier since I don't have to sit there digging hairs out of the blades so I could continue shaving.\n\nI run it under warm water when I shave. For the lotion, it's great, but I have to be honest -- I barely use it. I use a pea-sized drop for each side of my face, and then the rest of the experience is all warm water. It works great, though, and I have no complaints. Not to mention that I've been using one lotion pouch for *weeks* now... But I guess I should mention I only need to shave every 2-3 days, not every day. A little stubble never hurt anyone. (And being a musician, I don't have to worry about leaving a good impression on office types.)\n\nOverall I'm surprisingly satisfied. I also admittedly chose this one because it's an awesome green. My only REAL complaint is that, considering the nature of this razor, I can't shave between for my eyebrows. So for this, I've now gotten into the routine of tweezing, if only to avoid the putrid unibrow.", "I bought this shaver about a month ago because I'd had enough of cutting myself with my viscious Gillette Mach 3. Three cuts at a time on the cheek. Ouch! The good news is that I have no regrets buying this Cool Skin and I don't think I'll be going back to the Mach 3 any time soon. Like all things tho', pluses and minues:\n\nPluses:\n\n- No more cuts.\n\n- Shaves as close as my Mach 3 with less irritation.\n\n- I can shave in the shower, which is absolutely essential!\n\n- Great looking shaver, and one of the few that doesn't look like my grandfather's. The green color is super cool, and my wife thinks it has even improved the look of our shower!\n\n- Very easy to clean under running water in the shower.\n\n- One charge lasts a week or more.\n\nMinuses:\n\n- Takes about 2 - 3 three times as long as shaving with a razor.\n\n- I don't mind the cost of the Nivea refills that much (see below), it's the waste generated by the empty sachets that bugs me. I wish they could have developed a refillable dispenser.\n\n- The \"advanced LED display\" is pointless. Do I really need a flashing light to tell me to rinse the razor at the end of every shave? Or do I need another light that flashes to tell me I can pump lotion just after the thing's switched on? If it weren't for that great green color I could have bought the cheaper model and got the same functionality at less cost. All you really need is a low battery indicator.\n\n- You pump the lotion or gel onto the heads with your finger or thumb. Using my finger gave me cramp in my hand. Using the thumb is OK. A more advanced design would be to have the lotion delivered automatically.\n\nFinally, what about the lotion and gel? I found both worked fine. At a pinch I've also used ordinary shaving foam and even just water applied directly to my face. The most comfortable and closest shave is however obtained using the gel or lotion. I just bought a 5-pack of lotion at Target for $4.99. One sachet lasts me 4 or 5 shaves if I'm fairly frugal with it. So that works out at about 25c per shave which isn't too bad.\n\nAll in all recommended for those who are thinking of switching from razor to electric.", "I ordered this shaver for my husband to replace his older Norelco Quadra. After trying it, we are returning it to Amazon. He says his old Quadra works better than the 7745X Cool Skin. It looks cool and the wet shave is nice but it takes longer to shave and the closeness is not up to expectations. The new shaver should shave as good or better than the older models. The shaver does work so if you don't have an electric shaver, this might be okay for you. My husband has dark, coarse hair and the blades just weren't \"cutting it.\" Fine, light colored hair might improve the performance but, my advice is to look for something else in the same price range.\n\nMaybe our expectations were too high or the shaver really is lacking in performance. There was only one review when we made the purchase and maybe this will help others out there before money is wasted."],

The holes and slots idea sounded pretty good to me.  However I found the Quadraction took longer to shave than my older Norelco's and was irritating to my face. So I decided to try the new Spectra version. Good thing I did because they have definetly improved on the slots and holes idea. This razor is sort of a hybrid of the quadraction and the reflex razors. The Norelco Spectra 8890XL is fantastic. It gives a close, irritation free shave as close to a quality blade (Mach 3 razor) as you can get. The nine comfort settings are a great feature. Also nice is the LCD display and you get 70 minutes of shave time off of a 1 hour charge.

Compared to my old shaver Norelco, the display is too small and dark a little hard to read, my old Norelco is big, bright and very easy to read, they really went backwards in this part of the design.\nNIT PICKING: It feels like the blades should spin faster but since the shave is so good, probably not fair to put this as a con.\nCONCLUSION: I love the shave compared to my old Norelco 985RX and that's what matters the most, I would buy it again, but that switch, stand and display make me give this item three stars."],

Arrived in a beautiful box with pretty pink silk around it. Also, it came with a mini roll on tester of their scent Kindle. Both scents are lovely. When I first opened the box it smelled like an old lady, so for a second I was worried the perfumes would too.\n\nFirst, Kindle smells like real fresh rose buds before you put it on, then once on the skin it goes into a mix of a floral and woody smell, and lastly after it fades a bit you get a floral musk smell. Second, Enchanting Lure has a citrus pepper scent before being put on skin. Once on the skin it's a mix of lily, lemon, and musk. After its faded you're left with only the scent of lily.\n\nAlso keep in mind that these perfumes will smell different depending on your body's natural musks. Some days a certain note of the perfume will be stronger than others. Overall I think this was a great buy. I'm very happy with my perfume and hope to buy more in the future. (:", "This came very nicely packaged. I have worn this fragrance a few times now and even though I cannot seem to smell it after awhile. I get great compliments about what I am wearing!

    "description": "\nThe Best Way to Aerate Wine in Seconds! Allowing wine to breathe, to mix and mingle with air, enhances its taste and enliven its aroma! It was done traditionally by pouring wine into a decanter which has a large surface to allow wine to be exposed to air, but it takes 30 minutes or longer, now with this instant wine decanter, wine aeration is done in seconds!\nAdjustable Aeration Speed! Just turn the stainless steel band to pick an aeration speed, choose from 0 to 6! 0 speed means no air coming from the center air tube, the air hole is closed, you can tell by seeing no bubbles at the bottom of the aerator where the wine coming out as you pour the wine. From 1 to 6 speed, the higher the speed, the bigger opening of the air hole from the center of the air tube, the more air mixes with the wine, the more bubbles you can see. One neat device for all different kinds of wine. It is great for red wine, but white wine can also benefit from some aeration! Try it to see the difference it makes! Buy one for red wine, and one for white wine! Experiment with different speed, and find your favorite speed!\nMulti-Stage Aeration! The first stage occurs when the wine hit the little umbrella on the top and splash to mix with air, then the wine coming through the tiny draining holes in the middle, wine is exposed to more air, then coming down to the mixing chamber to mix with air from the air tube and forming lots of bubbles at the exit tube! Because of these multiple stages of aeration, the wine is aerated in seconds as it goes through the different stages of dancing with air!\nBeautiful and Sleek Design! Very Portable This gift set includes: the aerator, the silicone stand, a travel pouch, and a beautiful gift box, ready to impress your loved one! Great gift for wine lover! Best gift for him or her!\nFree Ebook included to help you to learn more about wine tasting!",

How often and how long before any chage is apparent.", "I bought Galvanic spa set about 2 months ago.  I was literally 'pushed' to buying it because one of my biggest customers sell it.  After getting it, I find the instruction flimsy at best and doesn't really tell me how to use the product.  I needed to go YouTube to gather further information.\n\nI am currently onto second month of using the ageLoc facial gel and ageLoc body gel.  I really really liked it.  While I do not feel much difference with the body gel, the facial gel really does 'clean' up my face brilliantly.  I now feel less 'bumps' on my face as I used to have really bad blackheads and white heads issue.  People who hadn't seen me for a while suggested that my face is looking more youthful and brighter.\n\nAs I mentioned, the body gel didn't seem to give me the effect I envisaged, however, I do have comments saying that I looked like I lose weight, I primarily apply said gel on my stomach, thigh, calves and lower arm area.  While there seemed to be some 'shrinkage' on my stomach area, I couldn't seem to get rid of cellulite on my thigh area.  Under arm fat and calves remained pretty much the same.  Although, I do think they 'felt' smoother.\n\nThe prices of the said products are, however, rather atrocious, as such I only used facial gel twice a week and body gel 3 times a week.  Body gel looks bigger (bigger bottle and all) but it really doesn't last long as we needed to apply quite a fair bit for the machine to glide through without much issue.  With my current usage, one bottle of body gel lasted about 2 weeks and I have to change batteries every 2 months.\n\nI would have given the product a 5 star if\n1 - the pricing is more reasonable\n2 - the spa set is not that flimsy (with the body conductor, it tends to feel really loose and sometimes the gel leaked into the conductor) I am using Galvanic spa II btw.\n3 - the spa set should be waterproofed at the price we are paying\n\nI would recommend the facial gel to anyone looking for a boost on their face, when your face feel cleaner, applying makeups just felt better.\n\nK"],

    "reviewText": ["Works like a charm.", "This is the first time I've ever purchased a foot file. From my pictures you'll see how clear it is I should have bought one a long time ago. The only time I ever get my feet filed is when I get a pedicure. Maybe once a year. Having the ability to do that at home will definitely help me keep my feet looking, well, normal.\n\nThe wood on the file looks really nice and it comes with a suction cup and string so you can hang it up if you want. The red side of the file is quite coarse to help really clean up your feet, but causes no discomfort at all. The black side is also coarse, but less so. It helps with smoothing. Overall it seems well made and like it will last quite a while.\n\nI haven't had it long and have actually only used it once, but just once made a huge difference. I did not follow directions and soak my feet for 10-30 minutes in salt water. I simple took a shower, dried my feet, and used the file on both feet for 5 minutes total. If I had soaked my feet I'm sure I would have got even better results. I also put aloe lotion on my feet after. I never put lotion on my feet and they're usually very dry and cracked because of that. I intend to use the file every day for the next couple days briefly after I shower until I get my feet looking good. After doing so I'll add the lotion as part of the regimen. Using the file is going to help keep me conscious of keeping my feet hydrated so it does more than just file. :-)\n\nAfter using the file I rinsed it off in the sink with mild soap. It took 10 seconds to get all the skin off and looking brand new again. If you have calluses or other rough spots on your feet this file is a great way to take care of that with little effort. I definitely recommend it.\n\nI received this file at a discount in exchange for my honest review. All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.", " i received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. i was not influenced by anyone in any way.\n UPDATE: 6\/2\/2016. I've had this product since January 13, 2016 and the beginning of this month the callus remover strip has start to break way. I would have updated earlier, but I forgot. I still use it and I still like it, but my 5 star has dropped to a 4 star because the longevity of the product. It probably should not be pulling away so soon. I keep it up right so it's not hitting any water after my shower.\n-----\nI have been so needing one of these. I have tried others but sad to say they were not as rough as this one and let me tell ya, I truly need a rough one. My feet are pretty dry. I love going for my pedicure's but the cost can add up. I would much rather just do it myself.\n\nSo, needless to say, I got a chance to try this one out and I have to admit, it's \"great\" It's perfect for \"me\" I have a home pedicure system. I soaked my feet for thirty minutes then I took this wooden foot file and went to work on my super dry feet. WOW, it worked wonders.\n\nI was going to put a picture up, but I'm sure no one wants to see my callus feet with dead skin. That's just gross. As far as longevity, well, that's up to you. You can wash these with hot water, but after a while, you will need to throw it away and get a new one. As far a price does, I have seen this same size at a brand store for a few dollars less. But you will have to actually go to the store and buy it, when you can order right here on amazon\n\n PRO:\n it's large\n does good at removing tough dried skin\n\n CONS:\n the suction does not hold\n\n Overall: It's a good callus remover. It works for me."],

OK, it's not a miracle cure here... I can tell it's on though. Perhaps the fact that I haven't really tried many things previously is part of the reason I'm noticing it.\nIt's a very thin serum.

Overall, I like the product. Great moisturizer. Smells ok. Doesn't break my skin out. Seems to absorb quickly. The only reason for the minus one star is sometimes it made my skin feel a little sticky. And if my skin felt sticky, I felt the need to add another lotion on top of this to make the stickiness go away and then I could apply my makeup. The best way to describe the feeling is that it feels like I just used a makeup primer for my skin.", "I use this along with the repair cream. I love the two together! It has a pleasant rose scent (my favorite) and I feel like the brightening effect has helped reduce the marks left by acne. It has also somewhat helped the appearance of my dark circles. That being said, my dark circles are not severe, so if yours are a real concern for you, maybe you should consider a product that addresses that problem directly. My best friend just turned 30 and asked me to buy her my favorite anti-aging products, so I got her LadyKin. She texted me within 3 days saying she loved it, and will continue to use these products (although she was not as big a fan of the Youth Activator because she dislikes the whitening effect)."],

I expected a similar shave, but this one is much nicer!\nThe shave is closer (I found moving it slowly works best), and the heads independently swivel, which is great for me esp. in the chin area.  The cord has an adapter of some kind at the plug (the old one was a straight-through power cord).  It also has a few cute extras such as a digital display of remaining charge time and cleaning needed alert.  The power button is a push-button instead of a slide-switch.  Finally you can rinse the blade assembly in the sink (although I still use the traditional method!).", "I've always used electric shavers cause I'm one of those guys that gets up 5 mins before I have to leave the house.\nI've owned 2 generations of Braun 5000 series shavers and I have not had one that shaves this good or so easily cleaneable.\nIt's nice that so many electric shavers on the market have all these bells and whistles, but lets get real, we only want something that shaves as good a razor.  And this shaver DOES shave like a razor without the nicks.\nPoints that I love about this shaver:\n* Quiet\n* Very close shave\n* Easily and dummy proof, since it reminds you, cleaning with plain running hot water\n* Good ergonomics\n* Lit LCD Display with info on status of charge and cleaning time\n* Semi-soft plastic stand, not the rigid plastics, just in case you knock it off the counter it won't crack.\n* Carry case\nPoints I didn't like:\n* Can't charge the shaver in the stand since the AC plug goes under the shaver.\n* Norelco's are probably the most expensive shavers on the market so you are really paying for the carry case\n* That's about all the bad points.", "I have always used electric razor, so probably I have both an advantage over some of the buyers as my face skin did not need the break in period, as well as a predisposition to use this type of shaving device.\nHaving said this I have nothing but praise for this machine.

The Norelco Quadra features a quick charge for a 3-minute shave, or a full charge for longer shaves. Quadra Action System adjusts the floating razor heads to hug the contours of your face. Indicator lights up when it is time to clean and razor rinses clean with tap water. Cord and cordless operation. Worldwide voltage. Includes deluxe pouch, protective razor head cap, coil cord and cleaning brush. No. 6885XL. Imported.\nThis 7-watt electric razor puts three individually floating shaving heads to work clearing away stubble. The stainless-steel heads adjust automatically in multiple directions to fit facial contours, while the blades shave in two stages, with slots for long hairs and holes for short hairs. Operating either with the cord or cordless, the razor provides a pop-up trimmer for mustaches and sideburns and rinses clean after use. It's perfect for the traveling man because it works worldwide on systems from 110 to 240 volts, recharges fully in one hour for 45 minutes of shaving time or charges in six minutes for a three-minute shave, and fits into a soft, molded plastic travel case. For those on the go, this shaver can be recharged from any 12-volt car or boat battery (special adapter cable is not included). An LCD light signals when recharging and\/or cleaning is needed. There's also a plastic stand to store the razor upright. Norelco provides a 60-day, full-refund satisfaction guarantee after three weeks of use and a two-year warranty against defects. --Fred Brack",

Using all pure, natural ingredients enriched with shea butter, you can feel the difference of our unique quad-milling process. Aromatic fragrances transport you to a moment of calmness, vitality, dreamin or well-being. This 150 Gram bar is a great value, the fragrance maintains until the soap is all used up.

    "description": "\nThe ProblemCrinkled cleavage? Baggy bosom? Night boob sweats? \nProduct Description>\/b>>br>The Solution is Titty Bear: chest wrinkle preventer. Breasts at night are no delight. They can flop over creating skin on skin sweat. They can rest in strange places causing embarrassing and unsightly morning breast wrinkles that take longer and longer to disappear as women age. But there is no need to toss out t-shirts and order turtlenecks. Just get a new bed buddy: Titty Bear. Besides being the perfect non-snoring sleep companion, Titty Bear loves to cuddle up right inside a bosom, keeping breasts separate and in place. The soft, breathable cotton cover doesn't cause sweating. For side sleepers, the memory foam filling is comfortable but also keeps breasts in place, avoiding the dreaded MBW (morning breast wrinkles). Adorable Titty Bear would never raise suspicion while sitting out and is easy to wash with its removable cotton cover. **Note: Breasts come in different shapes and sizes. Women sleep in different positions. Some women have a hard time keeping Titty Bear in place without wearing a top\/tank with stretch.Size: 6.5 x 3 x 2 inches Material: All cotton cover (exclusive of embellishment) with polyurethane stuffing\n*) ..*) .*) (.

I also crossed check the price against other retailers and Amazon.com was [less expensive] and shipped one day sooner.\nI have a tough beard that grows fast coupled with a tender face.  My Remington 300 was the first razor to allow me to use an electric shaver and make it through the day without looking like a beatnik; however, after 5 years the screens are impossible to find so it was time for a new shaver.  The new Braun came as advertised and was charged up the very first time in only 4 hours versus 14 for my old 300.  The charged and low charge lights are handy and the ability to charge a dead razor for a shave in 3 minutes is a great advantage.  I have found in the past that a preshave liquid improves the closeness of the shave and that has been true with the Braun as well.  By the third day my face had adjusted to the shaver and I am getting the closest shave ever with no skin irritation.  The shaver also does a great job with neck hairs and the occasional long hair.  One significant reason that I selected this razor was the changing of the screen and cutters at 18 months.  My old 300 required a screen or screen\/cutter replacement every 6 months so this saves $30 over that 18 month period.  When selecting a razor be sure to pay attention to this or any \"self-cleaning\" liquids that you have to purchase on a regular basis.  The 6520 uses a floating head but is switchable to lock the head for hard areas like under the nose.  I found that I still get the best shave by moving my hand against the grain of the hair before I run the shaver there and you will want to shave against the grain too.  This was required with my old 300 and is indicative of most foil razors.  This is not required of rotary shavers but most research that I read indicates that a foil provides a closer shave.\nI am very happy with this razor.  It works great!", "Braun 6520 is the best electric shaver made. I've tried a\nRemington and it is junk, you get a excellent smooth shave,\njust as good as a razor blade. I recommend the Braun 6520, to\nall men that are using razor blades, you will never use a razor blade again.", "Most men say that the only way to get rid of those neck hairs is with a rotary razor.

In addition, the razor offers a three-stage cutting system and delivers a smooth shave either with or without a cord. The razor has a pop-up trimmer for mustache and sideburns and works worldwide on 110- to 240-volt systems.

Would definitely recommend them to any fellow Dangan Ronpa cosplayers."],

    "description": "Here are some fantastic, crystal glass spa bar slab foot files, manufactured in the Czech Republic, in a variety of enticing colors. These are the so called &quot;slab bar&quot; type of file. Each file measures approximately 6.25&quot; (165 mm) long x 1 3\/8&quot; (35 mm) wide x 1\/4&quot; (6 mm) thick and weighs over 3 1\/2 oz. These files are crafted by hand in the Czech Republic, so dimensions may vary slightly. Each file has two filing surfaces. Tempered crystal glass is the starting material for manufacturing these heavy duty, superior quality, meticulously crafted files. The Czech Republic is where the world&apos;s foremost glass artisans reside. These crystal glass files reflect the expertise of these highly skilled, glass artisans. What differentiates these Czech files from the imitations made in China and elsewhere, is that Czech files have their gritty surface produced by mechanically etching the crystal glass surface. As a result, these Czech files will never wear out. They can be cleaned and will work just like brand new, over and over again! This crystal glass etching process is time consuming, requires great skill, and is expensive. The less expensive glass files, produced in China and elsewhere, have grit bonded with adhesives to the glass surface. These adhesive grit Chinese files wear out, unlike the Czech Republic files. The inspection and quality control process involved in these Czech Republic crystal glass files is outstanding! It is second to none! As a result of their anticipated longevity, these Czech files are considered &quot;green,&quot; or eco-friendly. Each individual file comes with its own durable, protective, clear, vinyl storage case. These files are easy to clean and keep sanitary. They can be sterilized via all standard methods (heat, autoclave, UV, liquid agents, etc.). Regular use of these files keeps your feet soft, smooth, and sexy!",

I've heard of it from blog and I've purchased it like a year ago. Now I'm getting my 3rd jar. Guys check out the ingredients of this cream! it 100% natural and raw! I've never bought anything like this before! I don't have any cystic acne I have much less of regular white had acne, but I've changed my make up as well. I don't use liquid foundation any more and I don't use any chemically active ingredients on my face. I'm trying to eat natural food. \"Trying\"  doesn't mean happens all the time. Anyways this cream is the best!! I will suggest it to everyone!!", "Oh, wow. I thought I was the only one who had discovered this conceptually great skin food in my East Village neighborhood, at the Live Live boutique. I wandered in, captivated by Bee Yummy's minimalistic ingredient listing: honey, honey cappings, bee pollen, st. johns wort oil, royal jelly, water, and balsam needles.\n\nAfter trying a sample---- amazed by the non-sticky residual, super quick absorption, and raw, organic goodness--- i snapped up a whole selection of Live Live products: Bee Yummy, the Honey Face Mask (very pricey), and the Love Butter (100% pure coconut oil). Out of all 3 products, the Bee Yummy and Love Butter are the best.\n\nBee Yummy quickly sinks into skin like a serum. It is best for oily skins or young skins who don't need extra hydration. Unfortunately, it doesn't do much to truly hydrate as it has the texture of a very light water-based, \"teen-ish\" moisturizer. It will NOT keep you moisturized in the dead of winter--you'll still need something more occlusive. But no doubt it's good for your skin --so, i use it as a underserum before applying my heavy duty moisturizer and after my vitamin C potions as a \"middle layer\".\n\nIf you are looking for a basic, oil-free type of hydrator, why use one laden with chemicals when you can use this? If you are looking for anti-aging superpowers, forget it. This won't help, but it won't hurt. I have not had any miraculous \"magic\" healing with this product and don't expect it to. It is not a magic potion.  Take Bee Yummy for what it is: a organic, natural alternative to a basic light moisturizer."],

This was the million-dollar idea of Yoganshi Shah and Hiral Sanghavi. Eventually their goal is to incorporate their background of electronics and software to create smart apparel!\nConvenience on the go. That is what Yoganshi Shah thought of when her husband, Hiral Sanghavi, kept forgetting his neck pillow when he travelled.

The outcome was a functional jacket designed for accessibility and comfort. The BauBax jacket has 15 features that helps all travelers and people on-the-go stay organized with pockets for a tablet, smart phones, sunglasses, and even a drink pocket. To add to the overall functionality, there is space to hold earphones, built-in eye mask, gloves that extend from the sleeves, and comes with a microfiber cloth to keep all eyewear sparkly clear.

By doing this, it helps to help keep future breakouts from happening. Daily use of this soap will substantially reduce the amount of acne present and over time eliminate it all together. Our soaps are more than \"JUST SOAP\", because the ingredients we use are premium quality ingredients, so it turns the already moisturizing soap bars into specialty soaps designed to do more for your body than just clean. All of our soaps are carefully handmade with high-quality, luxurious oils, essential oils & herbs. This soap will produce an amazing lather and your skin will feel clean and pampered - not stripped and dry, without using too much. Our handmade soaps are crafted using the traditional hot process method with at least 80% olive oil and all of our essential oils are from 1st distillation. Our soaps are made in small batches and we cut them by hand so sizes and weights may vary. Each bar normally weighs around 4.6 oz (130g).

Make sure to relax your muscles and be sure that your measuring tape is held snugly, but not pulled tight. Look to see that the tape measure horizontal to the ground. Measure against the skin for best reading. Round to the nearest half inch.\n    -How we measure Waist:\nRest your hand on your hip and bend towards the same side. The deepest wrinkle indicates your waist level, and is usually at or slightly above your belly button. Make sure that your measuring tape is level with the ground and is held snugly, but not pulled tight. Measure against the skin and do not suck-in for best results. Round to the nearest half inch.\n3.

I probably have to make sure I cross each area about three times in different directions (mostly going against the grain of the whiskers) to get everything.

Our most advanced manual toothbrush provides unique cleaning action that whitens and cleans as part of your complete dental health regimen.   Electric vs Battery     Choosing a Battery-Powered or Electric Toothbrush With so many electric toothbrush types available on the market, it's often difficult to select the right toothbrush for your own needs. First, let's distinguish between electric toothbrushes and battery-powered toothbrushes. Battery-Powered Toothbrush Those who want a dose of power but are weary of electric toothbrushes may like a battery-powered toothbrush (also known as a \"battery power toothbrush\" or a \"battery-operated toothbrush\"). Like electric toothbrushes, battery-powered toothbrushes are sometimes simply called \"power toothbrushes\" due to their use of a battery. While similar in design and cost to regular manual toothbrushes, battery power toothbrushes have just enough vibration to add some extra cleaning action. Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush A rechargeable electric toothbrush, also known as a \"power toothbrush\", is the kind you plug into the wall to recharge, keeping the handle and replacing the brush head every three months or so. Rechargeable electric toothbrushes differ among the kind of cleaning technology they use, such as oscillating-rotating or sonic technology. Toothbrush Features Generally rich in technology and features, electric toothbrushes provide many oral health benefits. Some can even enable you to improve your brushing habits. Hi-tech features include:  Numerous brushing modes specialized for sensitive teeth, whitening benefits or gum-massaging action Pressure sensors to signal when youre brushing too hard Timers to help you keep track of how long youre brushing each quadrant of your mouth Oscillating-rotating or sonic technology Multiple brush head compatibility so you can choose which kind of bristle design you prefer  Many electric toothbrushes also come with features for added convenience, like a brush head or toothbrush holder and bathroom-counter storage units.

As with most parts, you may need to pluck a few stray hairs and use concealer to blend in to make the part more realistic.

    "reviewText": [" I have used this facial brush more than one month and I canft help myself loving it. Before this one I have another one for more than 2month, I use it every day and night. But it isnft waterproof. It broken when I taken shower. I love this one for reasons below.\n1. Unique package and design. I love the color-light purple which is a very shining and young color. When I receive the product I was shocked. It comes with a very specific instruction to tell you how to operate it and what are the different functions between the heads. I really really love the unique design. It keeps the entire product in one place. I usually take it when i go out for travel or business.\n2D Multifunction. It comes with 5 different function heads. I will go over each one for you.\nThe big soft brush. I use it every day and night, I have a sensitive skin so I extremely strict require on facial brush, but this big soft brush I like very much, I usually use it with DHC facial foam, it really clean my skin even in to my pole, only within one week I can see the dramatically decrease of the blackhead around my nose.\n\nThe other head is sponge. You can use it to wash your face or body. But the main reason I love to use this face sponge is that I can use it to apply my foundation. You can apply any other care product as you want. it does a great job of distributing you foundation or other skin care product.\n\nBefore going to the other heads I want to talk about the main unit which requires 2AA batteries. It is waterproof so you can use it in the shower. You donft need to worry the battery will get wet .Because the cover will highly protect the battery and allows you to sink when use it in the shower .you can continue use it day after day. on the main unit there is a button on the middle when you press it one time it will rotate one the right side when you double press it will rotate on the left side. Very easy to operate.\n\nThe small nylon brush i like to call it small body brush or feet and hands brush. I suggest not use it on the face. Because it was little hard .I usually use it to remove the cetin on my body every three days. But since it was small it does take little time. If you are in hurry in the morning I will not recommend you this. But if you have time in the night before go to bed I highly recommend you use it .Spending little time in the shower and taking some time to the body washing you can feel how soft and how smooth your skin will be. If you still have no time you can use it on your hands and foot. You can extremely feel the different changes of your skin.\n\nThe following I will introduce for you is the Pumice. The instruction recommends to use it on the hand or foot to remove the rough skin. But I found it has another function. I usually use it to polish my nails, it is very easy to control, you only need to attach it to the massager, rotate it within 2-3mins your nail will be polished and looks very shining, smooth and nice.\n\nThe last heads is massor. A very very useful head. It cannot give you a feeling like to go to some place for massager but it can give you some feeling like massor and make you feel relax. I also make the massor to my neck and shoulder. I usually tend to carry a lots of stresses here so I use it every night .it makes me feel much better.\n\nThatfs all the heads I want to recommend but the most attractive things is the price. Only $25 without shipping can get this multifunction and waterproof facial brush. My previous one costs me more than $60and itfs not waterproof. I also have checked some waterproof one on Amazon which cost more than $100 So this one really deserve to have. The quality is more than ten times then it price.", "I've used the MS facial brush for several days and now write my opinion here.\nI am a twenty-seven-year-old female who is raunchy, has combination skin, i.e., too oily on my forehead and my nose, and too dry on mouth and cheekbones. My cleansing regiment has always consisted of briefly washing my face which is easy to tend to break out with pimples and blackheads. So I purchased this facial brush wish it could clean my face deeply. And it never let me down. Its very easy to use. Put in the battery correctly and push the button. It will rotate clockwise and if you want to change the direction just repress the button. For my skin firstly I will use some cleansing oil to remove the oil and dusty on my face (even though you don't make-up, you still can use the cleansing oil first). Usually I choose DHC cleansing oil; I think its much better than others I have used. Then I use some water to clean the oil and use cleansing cream again to wash my face. The cleansing cream brand I use is Neutrogena. (You can choose type which is suitable for you). last step is to lead some nutrition into skin. I will use the sponge to do this step. (The sponge also can be used to remove the make-up) I think is much easier for skin to absorb the nutrition.\nI have been using the facial brush more than a week now I can see the dramatic change of my skin; at least my face is not as oily as before and seldom gets pimples. So if you have a skin like me, you can also have it try.", "Broke after a few uses"],

I had to remove the carpet\/liner on the back by the back window. I had to remove the storage container the holds the jack etc. I had to remove the back window motor and hold it up while putting the box in. (I recommend 2 people for this so you don't damage your subs, because the box is heavy once you get the speakers in it, and you have to hold the motor up and put the box in simultaneously.) I also had to remove the 2 cabin pressure vents behind the carpeting because the box wouldnt fit with them in, and kept pushing them out the back of the cab. Very frustrating and unexpected. I ended up getting 2 small pieces of lexan, removed the vents, and sealed over the holes with a waterproof adhesive. I popped the vents out the back and pushed them down between the cab and the bed. I cant get them out. Im still trying to figure that part out. If I didn't do that, water wouldve gotten in the cab. Super annoying installation, but its nice so I couldn't give it less than 4 stars. I put 2 Planet Audio AC10Ds in the box. They are not shallow mount or pancake subs. So I assume most regular 10s will fit but Im not sure. Allow some time to complete the install.

You can make these hairstyles as tight or as loose as you want depending on how much hair you gather in the pin as you flip it, so it's good for those that have a lot of hair to wrangle as well as those who get headaches if their hair is pulled back tightly.  If you have past your shoulders that is wavy or curly (like the model in the diagrams) I think that is ideal, but I think you can make it work with most hair types.\n\nFor less than $5 for a 2-pack it's worth a try, and if it doesn't work for you, pass it on to a friend with a different hair length\/texture.", "Love it"],

I THEN USED A MODEL 805, PURCHASED IN 1992, WHICH WAS MY FIRST RECHARGEABLE TRIPLE HEADED NORELCO.BOTH THESE RAZORS GAVE ME AN EXCELLENT SHAVE WITHOUT ANY IRRITATION, SINCE I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN.I JUST PURCHASED THE NORELCO 8260 AND WOW. WHAT A CLOSE SHAVE.YOUR RAZORS HAVE AGED WELL WITH QUALITY AND THERE ISN'T A BETTER SHAVER ON THE MARKET.I HAVE TRIED FOILED RAZORS IN THE PAST,BUT I ALWAYS COME BACK TO NORELCO. I AM A VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER.", "I bought this shaver to replace my old Norelco shaver that I'd been using for many years, and that finally broke.  This one was about double the price of that one, but I'm very disappointed to have to deal with the large \"cleaning system\" that came with the new shaver.  The picture on Amazon shows the shaver in a cute little stand; the reality is that it comes with a huge cleaning stand that I have no room for.  It seems the electric shaving folk want to get into the razor\/razor blades game, by selling cleaning solution for the shavers.  I'm not sure how important this is; my old one lasted very well with just a weekly \"dry clean\".  It also seems environmentally unfriendly to be wasting some water every day, and throwing out a plastic bottle every month or so.\n\nIn addition to the cleaning stand being bulky, a terrible design decision is that you can't leave the shaver plugged into it, because it will harm battery life.  Having something this big is bad enough, but having to unplug it all the time is ridiculous.\n\nThe packaging is the old horrible packaging, with unopenable plastic over everything, not the new Amazon environmentally friendly packaging.\n\nOn the other hand, the shaver works as well as the old one, and you can just ignore the cleaning stand if you want, since the recharger can plug directly into the shaver.  I'd probably be perfectly happy with the shaver if it had come that way; the extra stuff just seems wasteful.", "I just got the 8260 Norelco to replace my other 2 shavers(a Braun 8995 and a Panasonic Nano). This shaver is superior to both of my prior shavers,and here's why:\n 1. There is the noise issue. The Panasonic was annoyingly loud, the Braun was quite noisy, but the 8260 is very quiet. This may seem trivial,but it is nice to shave in peace.\n 2. The 8260 shaver truly shaves in one or two passes, and is completely non-irritating from the get-go. The Panasonic gets a little burny on the tough spots,and must be held at a specific angle to perform with it's angled blade technology and that is very annoying. The Braun requires multiple passes everywhere. Neither of the 2 foil razors EVER shaved my neck sufficiently, but the Norelco 8260 does an outstanding job there. I know they say a foil shaver shaves closer, but the Norelco far out-performs these 2 foils.\n 3. The build quality of of the Norelco and Braun are very solid, but the Panasonic seems cheap and flimsy. Also,replacement blades are cheaper on the Norelco,and you can't even find Panasonic replacements anywhere, so you have to order them from their site.\n 4. They all come with cleaning stands, which are gimmicky junk,in my opinion,but the Norelco version is the nicest. I wouldn't have bought any of these with the cleaning system,but these were either gifts or the same price with the claning stands. If I could save $40 or $50 bucks,I'd buy a model that didn't come with the cleaner (Braun 8975 or Norelco 8240).\n 5. The Panasonic allows wet shaving in shower or with foam, but I tried it once with foam and it was a mess. I prefer the simplicity of dry shaving.\n 6. The charge on the Norelco lasts WAAAYYYYYY longer that the other two shavers. It lasts like 2 weeks , and the other two only stay charged for a week\n Ultimately I am very impressed and surprised at the shave I get from the Norelco 8260 Rotary shaver. I have always purchased foils due to hearing they shave closer, but I can state clearly that that is not the case with me. I would buy a Braun again( it is very well-made and reliable),but I would not buy a Panasonic."],

I have used it only once, so far.  The one I received is fresh and not old smelling like the one another viewer received.  It does have a 'different' scent to it, but not offensive or old smelling. I ordered this because it has proven ingredients and such a tiny price on Amazon. The retail price on this is $140.00 and I purchased it here, on Amazon, for less than 20.00. I would never pay 140.00 for it or even close to that.  If it actually helps some, it will be worth it.  I am watching closely to see if it works, even have \"before\" photos, and will update my review after using this for a longer period of time. So many products make the claims their products work, but not all have the ingredients to back it up. I am giving this 5 stars based upon initial opinion and the impressive ingredients.\n\nBy the way, on the Amazon product page, it calls this FUSION BEAUTY LIFT FUSION. On the box it says it is M-TOX FACELIFT.  I thought these were two different products and I ordered the first mentioned one, so I am a little confused on this.  I will research it. They could be one in the same.\n\n I only wish this was shipped Amazon Prime. When shipped that way it is delivered by UPS to my door.  I buy as many as 30-80 items a month from Amazon using Prime 2 or 1 day shipping UPS.  I try to only buy products with the Amazon prime shipping but sometimes it is not possible to get some items that way. This was shipped USPS. The problem for me with this shipping is that the Carrier does not bring it to my door but delivers it to my box 1\/2 mile down the road.  We are in the mountains but easily accessible, but that's how it is. The thing I am concerned about on all my Amazon USPS shipments is that I am not able to drive down to the box (health problems) sometimes, for 3 weeks.  The  extreme temperatures could affect his product, in a metal container, sitting in a outside PO box when it gets in the 20's at night now. Part of one day  outside could affect the quality and integrity of the product.  Even when UPS delivers I try and make sure to get the items from the porch  asap , as the deliver person does not ring the bell anymore, just leaves the packages, which is ok.  95% of the time the UPS person comes before 10:30 in the morning so it helps to know the approximate  items get here.  I wonder if those who get funny smelling products, if it has to do with the products sitting outside in extreme temperatures for a period of time?  If there is anyone out there who is educated in this realm, I would appreciate your take on this issue,  if the extreme temperatures really do affect the cosmetic, food, dog food and other products in a negative way.

Need a light windbreaker or something more formal for that business meeting? Baubax jackets are available in 4 styles: sweatshirts, windbreakers, bombers, and blazers. All 4 styles are offered in a variety of colors and sizes as well.\n\"The swiss-army knife of travel wear\" - CNN Money Regardless the time of year, the BauBax jacket is your perfect travel tool.\nWe have identified and secured the best quality fabric manufacturers who are suppliers to the world's top apparel brands.\nFrom coast to coast, short or long distance, school or work, we have a jacket style that will fit your needs.\nWhat started out as a necessity for one person, turned into one of the most successful crowdfunding projects to date. This was the million-dollar idea of Yoganshi Shah and Hiral Sanghavi. Eventually their goal is to incorporate their background of electronics and software to create smart apparel!\nConvenience on the go. That is what Yoganshi Shah thought of when her husband, Hiral Sanghavi, kept forgetting his neck pillow when he travelled. Initially together they thought maybe an app would work to keep a working packing list. Yoganshi had a brilliant idea of creating a jacket that essentially embodies everything has a place, and everything in its place. The outcome was a functional jacket designed for accessibility and comfort. The BauBax jacket has 15 features that helps all travelers and people on-the-go stay organized with pockets for a tablet, smart phones, sunglasses, and even a drink pocket. To add to the overall functionality, there is space to hold earphones, built-in eye mask, gloves that extend from the sleeves, and comes with a microfiber cloth to keep all eyewear sparkly clear. Of course it has the built-in neck pillow that will not be left at home again.\nYou likely never heard of a travel jacket before Baubax, but it's the jacket you always needed but never existed.\nIt is good to have clothing that solves problems you face in your day-to-day life. We are happy that Baubax is doing that for tens of thousands of customers worldwide.",

Fatgirlsleep is by far my fave product of the line and one of my most favorite body products, period - it is the best. This product here, Hide and Glow Sleek is ok. As a self tanner, it is a great product. it goes on surprisingly even, dries super fast and has no scent at all that I could smell. It reminds me of a light airbrush spray, so it is very easy to work with and get nice, even color. I am very pale and I got the medium to deep shade and it does not look orange at all. I am sure if you spray it too heavily, too quickly, it might, but I ended up with  very nice color and not very dark at all - I didn't want anything too drastic. It gave me just the right amount of color to take away the paleness. I love self  tanning products since I am so fair skinned, but it is hard to find many that work well and not look fake or orange or too dark. It takes me awhile to build up a natural tan, so I always start the season with self tanners. As just a tanner, I like this one since the color is nice, even, and you don't even have to use your hands to apply it. You could just spray and go.\n\nThe directions state to spray even strokes down the leg, but I didn't really go in straight lines like that. It is a very fine spray, so it applies very nicely and lightly, so you can build up the color if you want. Once I spray an area, I kinda give it a once over with my hand to smooth and\/or blend it and it already feels dry and doesn't even need any blending. It has a very faint shimmer to it, which is what helps the \"sleek\" effect. The light reflects off those particles and helps to hide imperfections - like an optical illusion. I am not one for shimmery or glittery body products, but this is very minimal and I don't mind it at all.\n\nAs for the firming aspect, I don't think it is as good as the original Fatgirlslim cream or Fatgirlsleep (sleep version is fabulous, im telling you!) but it does make your skin feel smooth. I don't think it has the tightening effect that the creams do. It may be hard to deliver in a spray like this, especially if you use it lightly. Overall, though, I do like it and I will continue to use it. If I notice any further tightening effects as more time passes, I will update my review. With the Bliss creams, it is immediate so I expected the same with this spray.\n\nAs a tanner, I'd give it 5 stars\nAs a slimming\/tightening\/firming product, I'd give it 3 to 4-ish stars so far. The effects of the shimmer reducing the appearance of cellulite and dimples allows for the rating to be closer to 4 stars.\n\nIf you really want to feel your skin tighter and lose the appearance of dimples, try Fatgirlslim or Fatgirlsleep. Your skin will say thank you!!", "This works pretty good! The color looks subtle and natural. I haven't noticed any firming effects yet but maybe that happens gradually.

    "description": "How to Use   Apply nail polish on your nails and wait until completely dry. We recommend using fast dry top coat over nail polish or bare nails to create a flat surface which helps the product stick better. Make sure nail is dry and free of oily residues before applying product.   Lightly push tape\/stencils to the nail using a finger, especially paying attention to the areas near skin, cuticles, and the tips of long nails. You can always cut nail tape to size if they are too long and cut stencils to help them form better to the tip, sides and curvature of the nail. Try peeling stencils from different directions if you have trouble with smaller pieces not remaining on the backing paper. Find your direction and peel fast, holding stencil close the backing sheet. When small pieces remain within a stencil, flip and stick\/peel the stencil to the back of the paper to remove all stuck pieces.  Apply fresh or thinned, not thick or gloopy, nail polish across the tape\/stencil. Shimmer and metallic nail polishes work better than cremes. We recommend applying nail polish with a sponge lightly pushing it to your nail, similar to ombre design, this prevents any polish bleeding under the stencil giving cleaner lines. Remove extra nail polish from your skin and cuticles by using a flat brush dipped in acetone or nail polish remover.  Remove tape\/stencils immediately after applying nail polish using your fingers, tweezers or nippers while the polish is still wet. For better results pull the tape following its edges and stencils following the pattern.   Wait until your design has completely dried before applying top coat. Use fresh or thinned top coat, hold your brush parallel to your nail and try not to touch a nail with the brush, only the top coat drop should touch the nail to prevent smearing.  ",

But after looking for a while, I found a similar model in a NY pharmacy made in China with a reasonable price of $20. It works pretty fine and I'm happy with it. Assuming that the manufacturing cost in China is only 80% of the retail price, I believe that Norelco could be obtaining a profitability margin that goes close from 200 to 500% compared to the 5 to 10% of the Chinese product.

This nice, discreet back and body scrubber does the trick. It's made of very durable material, which means that it will probably be around for a long time.\n\nOne side of the back scrubber is rough, which is great at exfoliating dead skin. The other is soft, which worked well with my body soap (good sudsing action)\n\nAll-in-all I recommend this fine product, you won't be disappointed.", "I've used a lot of loofah's, but this one is by far my favorite. It's designed to be for the back, but I didn't stop there. It made all my skin feel smooth and polished without being to abrasive on my sensitive skin. This exfoliated better then the others I've used in the past. It held my body wash well, but also rinsed clean easily.", "I love this thing.

    "description": "Amazing soft and smooth skin is what you'll have after using the Mineral Springs Luxuries exfoliating back and body scrubber. The 30 inch long scrubber is long enough to ensure you can reach all those hard to reach places. It's one of the longest scrubbers you can purchase, which makes it perfect for men and women of all sizes. We want to make sure you can exfoliate and clean exactly what you want to clean, so we made the scrubber an extra thick 4 inches wide. Some of the cheap thinner ones will just roll up on themselves, twist, or fold in half. Why waste your hard earned money on something so inferior? Customers told us they wanted a scrubber just tough enough on one side, but soft and gentle on the other. We delivered with this scrubber one side of the scrubber feels like a loofah, and will exfoliate your skin nicely. Next, turn the scrubber over and polish your skin with the soft, gentle cotton side. Your back and skin will thank you for it the straps are made out of strong, long lasting rope handles. They have just enough give in it to ensure you can move the scrubber in any direction you need it, but is strong enough to handle all the scrubbing you can give it the Mineral Springs Luxuries loofah scrubber is great for personal use, or great to give as a gift pair the scrubber up with your favorite body soap, and you have the perfect spa gift to give to your friends, co-workers and loved ones.",

It's been about 3 weeks since I've used the 9160xl and it's been good so far. I did have a couple of weeks adjustment phase even though I was using my Quadra (maybe the technique I use). It was irritating in the cheeks area initially but now have got adjusted, it's cool. The major improvement is in the jaw and neck region, not at all irritating and the sensitive modes do help. I think the Smarttouch is a plus than the SpeedXL models (again that is at a personal level), I feel it's easier on the wrist.", "I've been a Norelco user for several years now. I have a thick beard, and am always looking for an electric razor that can give me the convenience and close shave. When you figure that a Gillette razor with all those blades you have to keep replacing, an electric razor can actually save you money from the conventional shave. My first Norelco was a Reflex that I inherited from my grandfather. It was pretty old, so its rechargable batteries died. The Quadra series came out, so I tried switching to that. I found it did give me a closer shave because the heads were flexible and could better fit the contours of my face. It worked fine, and then the Spectra came out. The differences between the Quadra and the Spectra are not great. The main thing is that the Spectra has a sensitivity dial (with my beard, I always have to have it set to the highest setting....which is pretty much like the Quadra). It supposedly has different heads....the blades are exactly like the Quadra and the slots are slightly different. Basically, there isn't a big difference between the two with shaving. I did find that one benifit of the Spectra was that you can use it as a corded razor while it's recharging (the Quadra and Reflex only run on batteries....so when the battery dies, you pretty much have to chuck the razor).  I can honestly say Norelco has seriously upgraded with the smart touch system. Each head has twice as many blades....with 3 rows instead of one. The heads also sit on a cradle that rocks back and forth. So it can reach any pesky curve or crevice on your face. It's certainly worth plunking down the money if you have a heavy beard and are looking for a close shave from an electric razor.", "Got mine about a month ago...\n\nPositives:  I'm still on my first charge, so battery is good so far.  Shaves slightly better than my older Norelco.\n\nNegatives:  The rubbery surface does not feel as comfortable as my old one in my hand.  Hair stubs get stuck on the rubber surface, and are harder to clean off. The entire blade assembly comes apart from rest of shaver - be careful when you first clean it, as I didn't expect it and dropped it.  I don't know why, but I often get a handful of hair stubs when I shave.  That's kind of annoying.\n\nConsidering that you can get an older model for half the price, I would say save the money and get a cheaper model."],

    "reviewText": ["I was looking for a replacement for the floss I had been using (Johnson & Johnson \"Reach\") because it shredded when pulled between my teeth which are close together. This is a common problem with a lot of brands of floss, especially the cheaper stuff. Even though the Glide is three to four times more expensive, I decided to give it a try and am very pleased I did. It simply works great. Its construction is more like a tiny tape and does easily \"glide\" through the tight spaces between my teeth and not a single shred, tear or problem. It is wax-coated, but does not feel \"waxy\" or leave wax residue. Also, since it does not shred, I will be able to use much shorter lengths, which offsets the increased cost. This product will definitely be something I will continue to buy and use in the future. As for some negative comments posted elsewhere, it sounds like they are not talking about the same product and may have been confused by the multiple packages on display. I had to study them for a while. What I finally bought (July 2011 at Wal-Mart) was the single package (since I was in try-out mode) and it is labelled \"New Look\" \"Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Original Floss\" 54.6 yards. It is manufactured by P&G and apparently dropped the \"Crest\" branding and substituted Oral-B. As another reviewer pointed out, \"Original\" just means non-mint (I don't care for mint). So, examine the identification on the package carefully to make sure you are purchasing the correct product.", "We always use this brand especially since my teeth are so close together.  This floss does not break and slides through teeth easily.", "I love Glide floss because I can use it, so I do.  This review is equally applicable to individual packs, but you'll get just over 218 yards of total floss in four 54.7 yard (50 meter) packages.  Glide used to make a single 100 meter package, but I haven't seen that recently.  Individual packs usually retail for just under four bucks, so this isn't a huge bargain.\n\nI was brought up on a rival floss that was little more than glorified cotton thread.  It was simultaneously thick yet prone to breakage.  I've tried waxed flosses, but they are disgusting: the wax scrapes off on your teeth and leaves you feeling like you've got more build-up, not less!\n\nA dentist gave me a sample of some Glide about 15 years ago (when it was a Gore-Tex brand) and I've been hooked ever since.  It slides easily between my teeth and leaves almost no build-up (despite the appearance of the white coating coming off).  The fiber has broken in use exactly 4 times in the last 10 years (yes, it's so rare, it sticks in my mind when it happens).\n\nAnother dentist warned me that Glide was not the best floss on the market, saying it wasn't that great at removing food\/bacteria\/plaque.  He recommended one of the waxy ones.  All I know is that I won't use that floss but I will use this Glide.  Since that's the real choice here, and using Glide is better than nothing at all, I'll stick to Glide.  I know it's doing a reasonable job because my gums are much healthier, according to dentists who prick the gum in 3 places around every tooth.  Blood and pain implies swelling from gum disease.  I have less blood, less pain, and therefore less gum disease.\n\nOther things to consider:\n1, This stuff is not as biodegradable as regular floss - as far as I know it's basically a plastic similar to the non-stick coating you get on certain kitchenware.  That means it seems fairly benign and there shouldn't be many long-term health risks, but it shouldn't be flushed away; better to dispose of it in the garbage.\n\n2, Glide (now owned by Crest I think) has released various other varieties.  I usually buy the mint one, even though I really can't taste the mint because I just brushed my teeth - it's not very strong.  The \"comfort\" one is thicker and more prone to breakage\/shredding in my experience.  Also, you only get four-fifths of the amount in each little package.  On the other hand, a (different) dentist recommended it, saying it was better at removing stuff, but once again I found it much less pleasant to use and couldn't wait to get back to regular Glide.\n\nNow if only they'd make it cheaper and fully biodegradeable, I'd give it five stars!"],

The trimmer cuts smoothly, consistently and evenly.  That you can use this trimmer in either corded or cordless mode is a very big asset.  The carrying case is a nice plus as well.\nMy only complaint is the pop-up trimmer, which is awkward to engage and seems a bit flimsy.  It works fairly well but is not as easy to use as the pop-up trimmers on the Norelco rotary shavers.\nSo far, I've used this trimmer every other day for two weeks on a single charge, and the LED shows that the batteries are still three-quarters charged.  This translates to two months on a single charge for me, and that would be excellent.\nI'd say it's safe to spend the extra bucks for this model; it's apparently worth it.", "The features on this beard timmer are well thought which makes the whole package rather satisfying.\nThe depth selection mechanism works via rotating ring which means that pressure on the guard won't change the cutting height (like my old trimmer).  The flexing guard is very comfortable and natural feeling.\nThe unit charges in an hour and holds its charge well.  A long overdue trim (from furry to chic) didn't even register on the battery meter.\nI don't find much use for the secondary fine trimming head.  It does cut closer than the primary cutter so you can clean up the trimmed areas without having to shave afterwards.\nWhile not the cheapest, this trimmer is certainly worth the price.  It has a solid feel and an excellent set of features.  Trimming with this Norelco is a very satisfying experience.", "This Trimmer is much easier to use and seems to be more powerful than the wahl trimmer I had before. I love the ability to see how much charge is left and to use the cord for 'emergency trimming'. Granted, it's double the price but for an essential tool that I use every other day convenience is very important..."],

Patented Zoom Ring adjusts to 9 length settings (.6\" to .72\") to trim hair precisely and evenly. Includes recharging power cord, guard attachment, cleaning brush and travel pouch. Automatic worldwide voltage adjustment.

Key to performance is the guide comb, which flexes and  adjusts automatically to facial contours, ensuring that chin and jaw  line are cut the same length as cheeks. Self-sharpening  chromium-steel blades last the lifetime of the trimmer. The head is  hinged for easy cleaning without disassembly. The trimmer works either  cordless or with its power cord and needs to be plugged in for 1 hour  to fully recharge. An LCD screen shows charging status and signals when the unit needs to be recharged.  Comfortable in the hand and handsomely encased in plastic with a  lacquered, metallic finish, the trimmer comes with a nylon  travel pouch and carries a 60-day, full-satisfaction, money-back  guarantee and a two-year warranty against defects. --Fred Brack\n\n",

Bodygroom allows you to groom your body without worrying about painful nicks and cuts.     Ultra Close Results Bodygroom's chromium stainless-steel blades deliver ultra close results.

Also I'm finding these specific refills harder to find now that they've come out with their \"new\" princess brush. This is very frustrating. The new brush is much bigger -- too big for small 6-year old mouths and too large for small hands to hold. By the time she's big enough to use it, she'll be out of the princess phase.  Braun should at least continue to sell the refills even as they're phasing out the old brush -- otherwise customers feel doubly cheated.", "Yes, this is expensive, relative to the other Oral B brushheads.  Why?  1) You're paying for Disney's licensing fees, just like for all the other Disney products made for kids (and adults.)  2)  It costs a little more to manufacture the feathered bristles they use for this brush head.  If you're not familiar with what that is, look closely at the \"business end\" of the bristles and compare them to the adult Oral B brush heads.\n\nIt's also possible that because they sell fewer of these, they have to spread their fixed costs among fewer units sold.  But that's only a guess.", "I agree with the other person about the cost.  It's ridiculous how much the refill is.  My daughter needs to use an electric toothbrush but it doesn't have to be Oral B.

The Brusybrush Bamboo Fiber Loofah Back Scrubber Belt takes the hassles out of scrubbing the back and will greatly improve the effectiveness of your skin care routine. With regular use, this bath exfoliator will leave the back skin smoother and softer with less signs of dryness. Plus, the body scrubber removes dead skin that can clog the pores and contribute to acne breakouts. With this Bamboo Back Scrubber Belt, it's incredibly easy to clean every inch of your back. The loofah back scrubber is shaped like a belt and features an easy-to-grip handle on each end. Just hold onto the handles and move the back scrubber back and forth along your back to cleanse and exfoliate simultaneously. The loofah panels on the bamboo bath exfoliator produce friction to gently lift away cellular debris without injuring the skin, so this loofah back scrubber is as safe as can be. Not just for the back, the Brusybrush Bamboo Fiber Loofah Back Scrubber Belt can be used to exfoliate your legs and arms as well.

It stops dry, cracked hands by protecting the natural oil in the skin from being removed by constant washing or by other antagonists such as paper, cardboard and fabrics. Natural antibiotics in beeswax speed healing of rough, cracked skin (hands and feet), blisters and burns. Use on face as a moisturizer and to preserve the natural oil in your face. Long lasting - one application lasts most users about 8 hours - a whole work day!! It is safe for children - use on diaper rash to protect and heal quickly and to prevent rash from reoccurring. Use as a safe, natural deodorant for underarm and feet. Bacteria that cause odor can't grow in beeswax!! Natural antihistamine in beeswax also stops itch, burn and sting. Use on insect bites, poison ivy, rashes, burns, etc. Use on skin conditions that exhibit itch, burn or sting or are dry and scaly or red (eczema, psoriasis, rosacea). Use on pet's hot spots to stop itching and scratching and promote rapid healing!! No scent is added to Waterblocker so its scent is that of natural beeswax. Waterblocker is non-greasy after it is absorbed (about 3 minutes) and long lasting since it won't wash off like most other creams.",

The ONLY downside about this particular purchase experience was the shipping... A whopping ten bucks!!!! I was shocked.. After all was said and done TWENTY DOLLARS FOR DEODORANT... a bit unfair I thought (smh).", "I ordered this for my child about 2 weeks ago. It said it was shipped and was supposed to arrive this week. Then today I got an email saying the order was canceled because the product was out of stock. Worst company experience I have ever seen!", "I had the opportunity to review Junior Varsity Naturals Kids Deodorant. We received full size samples of both the Cherry Blast and Citrus Sport natural deodorants to try. We kept the Cherry Blast, and gave the Citrus Sports to our friends' 10 year old son to try.\nThe girls were so excited to review this natural kids deodorant. Coco and I opened the package while waiting for Lulu to get off the school bus. When she got off the school bus, they decided that they needed to take a shower right then and there, but we had company over, a 4 year old family friend, and had someplace to be in about 35 minutes. So they took a shower that evening. I think this was the first time EVER that they were excited to take a shower over a bath. They felt the shower would get them to the deodorant more quickly, I think. Now it is part of their after-bath routine. And I'm okay with that. With all-natural ingredients and a pleasant, fruity smell, I don't mind that they're always reaching for their new, natural deodorant.\nI reviewed feedback about the deodorant we gave away.  The 10 year old is relatively active, and his parents' really appreciated that it was natural.  He had been using deodorant before, and this one is working out well.\nThis product is a good fit if you're nervous about the chemically-laden products currently on the market, especially when you're using them on your children. While my daughters are only 4 and 6, we've been using as many natural products as we can (afford), ever since my youngest was diagnosed with a congenital adrenal deficiency shortly after birth. And although many people wouldn't think that 4 and 6 year olds need deodorant, when they're playing outside, in 100 degree weather (like today, in Columbia, SC), they are STINKY when they come inside. This deodorant helps with that. I also like to rub it across the bottom of their feet, and it helps their feet not to stink and sweat so much.\nYou'll have to decide for yourself when it is appropriate for your children to begin using deodorant, but when you do make that decision, reach for an all natural deodorant like Junior Varsity Naturals Kids Deodorant It currently retails for $6.99. Plus, they offer free shipping for US and Canadian customers."],
