[{"asin":"B000256MZA","reviewText":["I purchased this book bag b\/c it was beautiful and spacious. My toddler is rather small therefore, it will grow with her. There are 2 bottle compartments and spacious interior for you to store, pampers, wipes, etc. it's a great bag, great price and great decor. I highly recommend :)","I've been dreaming about something like this for years.  I like to travel light and yet sometimes I would find myself wishing I could convert my small daily purse into a tote for larger items, a tablet computer or books - couldn't someone invent a convertible bag? Imagine my excitement when I finally found one!\n\nAlas -- the idea (and the pictures advertising the item) is better than the actual product which is riddled with design flaws.  Too bad too, because this is such a neat idea!  With just a few tweeks in the design this item could be great but as it is it barely works at all.\n\nCONS:\n* This bag holds next to nothing. All I could manage to carry throughout all compartments was 3 credit cards, 4 bills, a few coins, a chapstick and a small hand sanitizer. All items were packed in EXTREMELY tight and it was hard to get anything in and out. Had they increased the dimensions of the wallet or compartments by just a tiny bit this bag would be much more useful.\n\n* the small snap-closure pocket on the outside of the wallet section allows no room for any objects and bends the area on the interior wallet so that your credit cards bend and warp if you put anything in that pocket (there's only one spot for credit card slots -right on the wall of that compartment! They could have switched the credit card slots to the other side).  I did not over-stuff,  all I had in that pocket was the little chap-stick.  Certainly don't plan on carrying anything with any dimension in this pocket. At most you could fit a black plastic comb or a book-mark.  I don't know if it was because of the chap-stick or because of a miscalculation in sewing - but I couldn't get 1 row of the credit card slots to hold any cards at all- they seemed too narrow.\n\n* The back pocket is lined for phones or sunglasses but the angle of the pouch and the velcro closure made me nervous about putting my touch screen phone in this pouch - it felt like it might pop open and the phone could only fit in without its little case.  (There's no other place in the purse which would accommodate a phone... so unless you have an older, tiny, light weight clam-shell phone or one you don't care about too much -- you're out of luck).  Also this pocket is only gusseted for dimension in two sides --- and flat on the bottom. What's the purpose of this?  Even less fits in and it would have been perfectly easy to make one 3rd \"wall\" to make the pouch bigger. Doing it this way only makes items smashed and difficult to get in or out.\n\n* The WORST design flaw, aside from the small size of all the compartments is that getting the \"tote\" bag BACK into the compartment is very difficult and once unfolded, it never goes all the way flat again adding yet more ungainly bulk to the bag.  If you try to just stuff it back in, forget it.  You must fold the bag in exactly the way it came out... a feat that requires a little patience.  If you're bad at folding maps- just forget it.\n\n* The two straps for carrying on your shoulder or around your waist  are very thin and located on either side of the main zippered area which makes it awkward to get into the wallet area.\n\n* The bag is made of a stiff canvas material and is therefore not very light-weight.\n\nPROS:\n\n*When unfolded, the tote bag is much more useful and seems VERY sturdy and roomy.  -- You could use it just as a tote bag and never fold it back up with the wallet and sunglasses pouches still accessible on the exterior for trips to the beach I suppose - ...though there are more fashionable plain old totes for that purpose.\n\n* Someone who carries only a card and some bills or coins and sunglasses to the farmers market or on garage sale trips might find this little bag quite useful.\nFor that reason, I marked it as a \"3\" instead of a 2 star - which it more deserves.","Works well; I was given one at a baby shower which didn't have the opening for the wipes to be readily available; so I returned that one (which costed more even) and bought this one! Fits everything I need for a complete diaper change thanks to the additional compartment on the front."],"description":["Patented Magic Bag is an everyday wallet, tote bag, fanny pack or shoulder bag.

Those possessing the former genotype--RT\/WM\nreport a less offensive odor, while a few suggest it similar to vanilla or a floral.\n\nThe implication of the Rockefeller study is obvious: you can't know who can detect the scent or who will find it offensive or, conversely, slightly less offensive.\n\nClearly, the suggestion that androsterone will attract women to men like moths to a flame is utter nonsense. It may very well be that even if you are drop-dead good looking\n with a body like a Greek God, the woman you're  attracted to you may be one who gets a whiff of a urinal when you approach her; at the same time, if you connect with a woman\n\"out of your league\" (you're a six and she's a nine) it could be because you're sitting next to her at a bar during the Super Bowl, you're both Patriot fans and they win a nail-biter in overtime.\nIf she's with other girls (no boyfriend) she'll experience a rush of dopamine (The brain chemical that creates euphoria) which will give her a jolt of strong sexual feelings and you could,\nunder those circumstances, suddenly look like a nine to her.\n\nThe point: figure out a a way to get a girl to experience a dopamine rush and you're going to look a lot sexier to her.","this product is good girls think you smell good and thats about it. i had a few girls say i smell good thats about it and thats all your gonna need. with some charm and knowing how to talk to girls in the right way your gonna get results. its doesnt get girls to like you but just makes them think you smell good. just like a girl walking by with a nice smell, does it make you a a little more attracted to her?

I haven't actually put them on yet but I did extensive research on several platforms before i bought and it seems like a lot of factors are involved in the longevity of this product. Firstly If you are using these for natural nails then they will most likely wear off quicker just because of the natural oils on your hands and nails. Also if you have an active lifestyle and or use your hands frequently throughout the day for chores such as; washing dishes, crafting, building, typing even, you run the risk of premature chipping. With that in mind i wear acrylics and therefore believe they ,last longer on \"shop nails\" because they're synthetic and oils won't disturb the product.\n\nit is quite sturdy and thicker then i anticipated as well.

It does things for my skin that no other serum or moisturizer that I've tried over the last 35 years has.","I am an absolute fan of SK ii FTE. I was really skeptical at first about the claims about Pitera being an all-natural \"miracle\" ingredient. I won a sampler bottle (30ml) at a raffle and decided to give it a try. Anyway, what's one extra step in my regimen?\n\nMy skin broke out the first week I used it, which almost made me stop using it. My friend told me it's completely normal since that's my skin's way of releasing the toxins and renewing the top layer due to the reaction to the serum. As per her advice I religiously used it for another 3 weeks. I'm so glad I didn't stop, because after the initial reaction I began to see visible changes.\n\n2 weeks later my skin is significantly clearer (like 90% less blemishes), more firm, and almost glowing. The best way I can describe it is as if I'm going around all day like I just washed and toned my face. I've always had huge pores on my nose and rough spots on my jawline - now these are immensely improved. I even feel confident enough to go out without makeup.\n\nMy only complaint would be that in the weeks following when I ran out of FTE (and it took a while to buy another bottle since I was waiting for it to go on sale), I noticed my old skin problems returning. I don't know about rumors that your skin gets worse than it was before using it once you stop...for me it was just that I need to maintain a regimen or else my skin will just go back to its original state which I was not happy with. It's also quite pricey, but definitely worth every dollar. Plus you only need 3-4 drops each time, if you place it on your palm and gently pat it on. I would suggest not to use a cotton pad since most of the liquid is absorbed within and is wasted. Using your hands\/fingers also lets you massage your face and neck to get circulation going.\n\nDefinitely recommend this product - but do see a specialist if you have prolonged reactions more than 1 week.","Purchased this product for my mom and she loves it!

They love it too! Great item, thanks!","When the package came in the mail, I unwrapped it, and to my surprise, what was in the package was not the same thing as what was pictured. The cutting cape I recieved was a boys' cape with skateboarders on it. While the cape is still usable, it is not what I thought I was getting. Plus the cape I got is big enough to be a young adult cape, not a kids' cape.","1.  Good quality material.  The cape itself is made from a medium duty blend type of material.  It doesn't feel flimsy and is close to what you get at a professional barbershop.  The Velcro part is also good quality, there is stitching near the neck line to prevent itching and the Velcro itself is nice and strudy to prevent the cape from falling off.  Even if your kid tugs at it, it probably will stay on as you need more than a gentle tug to rip it off.\n\n2.  Makes cutting hair easy.  Not only does it keeps the hair away from your kid, but the cut hair glides off the cape easily so it makes cleaning up afterward easier.  All the hair falls to the floor gently so the hair is not flying every where, this helps keep sweeping to a minimum.\n\n3.  The price is fair.  Can you get a cheaper cape?  Yeah, probably.  But, for a few bucks more you'll get a quality cape that will last years.  I've even used the cape for myself and I'm 5'11.\n\nI would recommend this for every one who wants to cut their kids' hair.  It make's cutting hair more pleasant for the kids and makes it easier for you too.

But, I don't always have the time to sit down and spend hours creating unique and fantastic designs on my nails. Thankfully, I found these GORGEOUS gold stickers. They are the PERFECT addition to my nail art collection and make it easy to have stunning nails in a flash.

When they first arrive, it might look like they are going to be difficult to apply. But, they are NOT!! Seriously - SO easy!\n\nAfter you have your color on (you don't have to use gel like I do!), use tweezers to remove the sticker from the backing and apply it to your nail. Then, take your manicure scissors (you know, the ones with the teeny tiny tips), to gently and carefully trim around your nail and remove the part that isn't on your nail. After you're happy with how much has been trimmed away, use the beveled edge of an orange stick to make sure the sticker is fully adhered to your nail and then apply your top coat.

Wrinkle Therapy with CoQ10 &amp; Rosehip, for lines and wrinkles. This Cleansing Milk contains soap-free, botanical cleansers that gently lift away grime without drying or stripping skin.As skin ages and its cellular metabolism slows, collagen and elastin production gradually deteriorates causing wrinkles and sagging. This slowed metabolism is due in part to a decline in the skin's natural levels of Co-Enzyme Q10 and other energy sources. Studies show that supplementing the skin's natural CoQ10 production can help reverse and prevent these visible signs of aging. Wrinkle Therapy features a carefully selected blend of powerful natural wrinkle fighters. CoQ10 will boost skin energy levels to encourage regrowth of collagen and elastin; Rosehip Oil, high in potent antioxidants, provides intense free radical defense and promotes healthy skin rejuvenation; Hyaluronic Acid helps skin attract and retain moisture, resulting in a dewy, resilient and smoother surface texture. When skin is re-energized and its natural defenses are reinforced, it becomes firmer and more elastic, the appearance of lines and wrinkles fade and its overall complexion appears more youthful and healthy. Avalon Organics is grounded in the knowledge that all beauty begins within the Earth. Guided by the wisdom of nature, each product is thoughtfully crafted for optimal effectiveness while meeting a strict organic standard. Formulas contain carefully selected botanicals that are nurtured by the elements then tenderly harvested to nourish the body from the outside in.

I use the bigger one to get the bulk of the hair off my Wahl Elite Pro, and then I use the smaller one to get tighter, smaller spots.\n\n2.) The plastic is not flimsy (at least for the big brush). It's pretty sturdy and hard plastic. I don't foresee it cracking for trying to wipe harder. I'd have to check the smaller one again, but I had no complaints with the quality of smaller one. You shouldn't apply too much pressure with that one to begin with.\n\n3.) Packaging was pretty simple and easy to open. You just slip the back cardboard off and you can get the clippers from behind.\n\nCONS:\n1.) uhm, the smaller one I hardly use. Maybe just don't know how to use it properly.

The packaging says that it is a \"weight loss unit\" which obviously electro-stimulating muscles is not going to cause weight loss. I was just looking for a compact TENS unit to be able to use on sore and tight muscles. This unit takes 2 AAA batteries. It came with instructions that just give you basic warnings and locations for pad placement. There is really nothing about the individual unit settings and how they work for the muscles. The sensations are somewhat mild and when the unit gets turned up to a higher level it feels more like a pricking or poking sensation. The pads are also pretty small and so I would definitely recommend getting larger pads if you want to cover a larger area. I may be biased since I have used higher quality TENS units before and I know how they feel in comparison. Obviously this is a cheaper unit run on battery power so the strength and sensations you find with other machines just isn't there.\n\nPlease Note: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. I was in no way compensated for a positive review. I am a consumer just like everyone else and I often refer to product reviews to assist in making purchase decisions. The items I review are also all items I was already wanting to buy and use on a daily basis.\n\nIf you found my review helpful please click \"YES\" below. I am willing to answer any questions you have before you make your purchase, just ask!\n\nAll item(s) arrived on time as expected. All contents were professionally package and in perfect condition. I would definitely purchase from this seller again in the future!","This unit could be super great if it was not so shady looking. The packaging says it is for weight loss which is ridiculous. You will not lose weight using this unit. It also does not come with great directions and the packaging stated that battaries were included but there were none in my box.\n\nHowever, moving past those things the unit has potential. It is kinda like a TENS unit from my chiropractors office. TENS machines produce an electrical impulse that can be adjusted for pulse, frequency, and intensity. The exact mechanism by which it works to reduce or even eliminate pain is still unknown.  There are several possible ways TENS works. For example, TENS may inhibit (block) pain pathways or increase the secretion of the pain-reducing substances (e.g., endorphins, serotonin) in the central nervous system.\n\nThis unit is a noninvasive way to treat pain. Pain messages may be altered enough to provide temporary or even long-lasting pain relief. Besides controlling pain, this type of electrical stimulation can also improve local circulation and reduce or eliminate muscle spasm.\n\nTHis unit may  also be used for muscle soreness from overuse, inflammatory conditions, and both rheumatoid and osteo-arthritis. Athletes with painful acute soft tissue injuries (e.g., sprains and strains) may benefit from this type of treatment.\n\nAgain, it has great potential but I am sure there are better units out there if you suffer from pain. I was given a discount to provide an honest and unbiased review.","Years ago, my husband suffered a back injury at work. He was unable to perform his regular job and spent years on L&I. It was obvious that this was a life changing injury and that his back would never be the same. He saw several different doctors, underwent many different treatments, took tons of medication, endured tons of different tests and even attended a pain management clinic. Throughout this lengthy process, He was given a medical grade tens unit. It was the most effective tool he had to combat the pain. My husband went thru vocational training, attended the local community college and got himself a CDA and became a long haul truck driver rather than live on disability for the remainder of his life. Because he decided to better himself and not live on a government disability check, once his L&I case was closed, he had to return the tens unit. Of course a medical grade tens unit is ridiculously expensive and we simply cannot afford one. He has tried a few different cheap ones, but none has really done the job he's needed from it. I came across this one while browsing one day and figured it couldn't hurt to try given the fact it wasn't too costly. While it definitely doesn't work like the medical grade one, this little guy actually does a fairly decent job. Given that my husband is using this to relieve back pain and it helps, anyone looking to use this as a massager or fat burner should be extremely pleased. The unit requires two AAA batteries to work which are not included. Included with the unit a single cord that splits into four pieces, four pads that attach to the end off the cords and stick onto the body and an instruction manual.

Watching the youTube video on how to apply this is a must: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SUgkvYOyNIs\nThe first time I applied this polish, I didn't even know there was a video or special instructions for it. It was a disaster, the polish bubbled up and peel right off, like I had put elmer's glue on it. It also stains your skin and anything else it manages to get on. I love the colors and the metallic foal effect. It's worth continue to try again and again to get it right. I think I'll be looking for a no-wipe top coat to use with these as well. If the top coat is not fully cured when you go to wipe of the tacky layer, it cause what looks like water spotting on your nail. The instruction to apply this are found in the youtube video from Bundle Monster, but I will include them here as well:\n\nApplication Instructions:\n1 .Prep nails by pushing back cuticles and buffing surface of nails to get rid of any natural oils and shine. Wipe nails with alcohol or nail polish remover for a clean start.\n2. Apply a thin layer of base coat to prepped, oil-free nails and cure under lighting system.\n3. Apply a thin layer of top coat and cure again.\n4. Shake the metallic gel polish for 30 seconds to mix the metallic elements before application.\n5. For best results, apply metallic gel polish using a three stroke method, starting from the center base to the free edge of nail. Be sure to not overlap each stroke when applying the metallic color gel. Cure metallic color gel for 60 seconds in a LED system (2 minutes in UV).\n6. Repeat by adding another thin layer of color to nails and cure. Seal the color with a thin layer of top coat and cure.\n\nQuick Nail Tips:\n-If you have a top coat that has a sticky residue after curing wipe dry with alcohol before metallic gel application.\n-For best results, thin (almost transparent), slow, non-overlapping strokes of polish while applying this metallic gel create better, even color coverage.\n-Gently touch the surface of the nail after curing metallic gel to ensure the product is dry if not cure again. Drying time may significantly change according to application. When in doubt, cure again!\n-Only apply top coat gel to absolutely dry cured metallic gel, applying top coat to wet\/ partially wet metallic polish will not achieve the same metallic effect."],"description":[],"title":"BMC 6pc Metallic Foil Effect Nail Art UV\/LED Gel Polishes - Red Carpet Collection","image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41n1M1aU6nL._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41Go7-2QneL._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41W-8k%2B%2BvJL._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41EGa37-jaL._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41RLnh-OSFL._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/416GTp2wJHL._SS40_.jpg"]},{"asin":"B002N5MI3W","reviewText":["My wife picked this up for me a few years ago and I've been buying it since.

This razor is sort of a hybrid of the quadraction and the reflex razors. The Norelco Spectra 8890XL is fantastic. It gives a close, irritation free shave as close to a quality blade (Mach 3 razor) as you can get. The nine comfort settings are a great feature. Also nice is the LCD display and you get 70 minutes of shave time off of a 1 hour charge. Although the price may seem high initially when you figure in the cost of razor blades and shaving cream this razor pays for itself in no time. The Spectra 8890XL is the most feature loaded, highest quality electric shaver on the market.","PROS:  Good shave, feels good in the hand and easy to clean.\nCONS:  The stand is not nearly as good as my old Norelco 985RX, I have to put it on a little carefully or the shaver topples over.  I don't like the on off switch, it's a button and takes a little too much pressure to use, I prefer the slide on off switch that my old Norelco had.  Compared to my old shaver Norelco, the display is too small and dark a little hard to read, my old Norelco is big, bright and very easy to read, they really went backwards in this part of the design.\nNIT PICKING: It feels like the blades should spin faster but since the shave is so good, probably not fair to put this as a con.\nCONCLUSION: I love the shave compared to my old Norelco 985RX and that's what matters the most, I would buy it again, but that switch, stand and display make me give this item three stars."],"description":["Norelco's Spectra Shaving System, 9 Adjustable Settings, for sensitive to normal skin, for unsurpassed comfort and closeness.","The Spectra is Norelco's top-shelf model, and this version is the cream of the Spectra crop. It combines the company's best shaving components with cordless convenience and high-tech features. For the smoothest, most comfortable shave possible, the razor's surface is flexible to the touch with three individually floating heads. Combined, the Lift and Cut heads contain 45 lifters and 45 blades that raise whiskers gently and cut them cleanly. The result is an extra thorough, below-the-surface smoothness.","The shaver includes nine comfort control settings, so that you can adjust spring and pressure, plus a full-width pop-up trimmer for sideburns and moustaches. A luminous LCD shows remaining battery power in minutes and reminds you when to charge and clean the shaver. Charging takes just an hour for 70 minutes of shave time, and a 6-minute quick charge gets you 3 minutes in an emergency. The low-noise motor, comfortable grip, and washable razor head make the grooming experience even more luxurious, while worldwide voltage simplifies travel. The shaver comes with a stand, deluxe case, coil cord, cleaning brush, and protective cap.

From the reviews the hardness also varies by color.  Does anyone know the key? I couldn't find a rosallini website.\n\nThe Rosallini Colors are each different -- but how????\n\nSO HERE IS A SUMMARY.

I am a big believer in freshening up my skin with peeling products, both of the physical and chemical variety.  Over the years I have tried many different types and they all contain some sort of rough, gritty substance to mechanically rub off the top layer of the skin.  One of my peeling products has sharp fragments of pulverized apricot shells, another crushed salt, and my latest relies on sugar particles.\n\nI have never seen anything like this gel.  It is completely smooth and yet, after a few minutes of massage, chunks of dead skin ball up and come away. I find that rinsing with water is not enough to remove all the residual cell debris, so I use a facecloth or a sponge.  My face emerges refreshed and smoother than I thought possible with pores visibly tightened.  My sensitive skin loves this product and I have never had any undesirable side effects.  It's the sort of thing I can use before a night out, followed by makeup, or simply to prepare my skin for serum and moisturizer at night.\n\nThe modern, sleek container is really high-end and beautiful to have sitting on my bathroom shelf and, at the rate it's going, the 50 ml (1.69 oz) contents should last at least a month with regular twice-weekly use.\n\nI always look at the ingredients before putting anything on my skin, and the list here is full of most reassuringly natural extracts:  camellia leaves, sea salt, aloe vera, argan oil, orange peel, papaya, pomegranate, cucumber and Dunaliella (a micro-algae found in sea fields).  As with other Simon & Tom formulations, there is an equally long list of artificial and toxic ingredients that are NOT included.  It only took me a couple of uses to recognize this gel as the best peeling product I have used to date.  The fresh aroma and smooth texture make this a joy to use and, after rinsing, I don't feel as though I have rubbed away my fingerprints.","I like this peeling gel more than others I used.

That being said, I use this one the most. Not only does my skin feel hydrated instead of greasy in the morning, but after the third use I noticed less breakouts around my chin and jawline (I have hormonal acne and horribly sensitive skin).\nBlack Tea : This mask improves elasticity of the skin. I haven't used this long enough to notice a huge difference, but my skin does feel plump when I wake up, and my mom has had the same result!\nStrawberry - Like most strawberry skin care products, this one is for people who deal with dry skin. I won't need to use this until the cold seasons arrive, but my mom needs heavy moisturizing products year-round. Her skin has definitely been looking more hydrated and brighter!\n\nInstructions and ingredients are provided on the boxes, both in Korean and English.\n\nI only have two small complaints about the products:\n1. There's a very noticeable amount of fragrance. They all smell great, but it's a bit strong. Thankfully, the smell does fade after the moisturizer is massaged into the skin. My face normally can't tolerate products with so much fragrance, but so far all has gone well.\n2. The packaging. Yes, it is adorable, but I'd prefer the spoon be able to stay in the cup. You use the spoon to scoop out the tapioca pearls and smash them up in your palm. It's a long spoon, and it pulls out a lot of moisturizer with it. With this product a little goes a long way (which makes it a total steal at it's current price), so I scrape off a lot of excess.\n\nLike I said, those are small complaints, so this product is very much worth trying out. So long as Etude House keeps making it I'll keep buying it.","I love this stuff. I put it on before bed and wake up to plump skin! One of my favorite night time moisturizers.

(I use a stronger grit with a lower number for acrylic nails.)\n-  The grit is lasting much longer than my last file.\n- Instructions are printed on this file that it is washable and disinfectable.\n\nCons\n- None.\n\nI would purchase this product again.\n\nI often depend on others leaving honest reviews when I need to order a new item.  I find that one of the most difficult things about ordering online is that I cant hold or touch the products before buying them.  So, I love reviews from others who have touched, inspected, and used the item Im thinking about purchasing.  I strive for the same in leaving reviews for others  to leave a review that will help others make an informed decision (never to inflate the product's quality). I received this item at a discount or gratis from the manufacturer or a seller to objectively test and review it, but received no payment and have no obligation to offer anything other than my real opinion based on my experience.

If you have found this review helpful, Id love if youd indicate that below.  Also, feel free to ask any other questions about the product that I haven't answered.","I never thought I would be saying this, but I love these files. I have been a bit frustrated with the files you can get at the stores around me. Most of them are barely usable after one use. I wasn't expecting much when I ordered these but figured I would give them a shot. Much to my surprise they are one of the best files I've ever used. They look just the picture posted. I used one to file my nails down and you can't even tell I used it, the grit feels the same as when I took it out of the package. I can see getting many uses out of one, so I picture the three lasting for long time. It does say on the file that they are 100% washable and disinfectable, I have never washed a file before and if your getting these for home use I don't know that it would be necessary, but it you have a business or job where you do nails then that is an added bonus.

Its 100 degrees outside, 95% humidity and I have to be outside for work. This mascara does not budge! It thickens my lashes way more than I'm used to with tubing mascara (it reminds me of my other favorite brand \"Two Faced better-than-sex\" mascara.) But without all the harsh chemicals! Tips I have is to wear an eyeshadow primer and a light dusting of finishing powder (I use W3ll People's translucent setting powder... love that stuff!) before applying the mascara. Wipe the excess after you pull it from the tube and curl your lashes before applying. This stuff is amazing! I take naps with it on, even take a quick body shower and it looks fresh all day. I remove it with a homemade makeup remover made from organic jojoba oil, coconut oil and alovera gel and it comes right off. I will definitely be buying this again!!

However, I've still managed to burn myself!  The one thing I do not like about this new curling iron is that there is this really tiny groove that runs around the bottom of the barrel between the hot barrel and the handle.  My hair gets caught in this grove all the time, and it either ends up getting pulled out or crimped really funny.  I think as the curling iron gets older and is used more perhaps this groove won't longer be an issue.

The trimmer cuts smoothly, consistently and evenly.  That you can use this trimmer in either corded or cordless mode is a very big asset.  The carrying case is a nice plus as well.\nMy only complaint is the pop-up trimmer, which is awkward to engage and seems a bit flimsy.  It works fairly well but is not as easy to use as the pop-up trimmers on the Norelco rotary shavers.\nSo far, I've used this trimmer every other day for two weeks on a single charge, and the LED shows that the batteries are still three-quarters charged.  This translates to two months on a single charge for me, and that would be excellent.\nI'd say it's safe to spend the extra bucks for this model; it's apparently worth it.","The features on this beard timmer are well thought which makes the whole package rather satisfying.\nThe depth selection mechanism works via rotating ring which means that pressure on the guard won't change the cutting height (like my old trimmer).  The flexing guard is very comfortable and natural feeling.\nThe unit charges in an hour and holds its charge well.  A long overdue trim (from furry to chic) didn't even register on the battery meter.\nI don't find much use for the secondary fine trimming head.  It does cut closer than the primary cutter so you can clean up the trimmed areas without having to shave afterwards.\nWhile not the cheapest, this trimmer is certainly worth the price.  It has a solid feel and an excellent set of features.  Trimming with this Norelco is a very satisfying experience.","This Trimmer is much easier to use and seems to be more powerful than the wahl trimmer I had before. I love the ability to see how much charge is left and to use the cord for 'emergency trimming'. Granted, it's double the price but for an essential tool that I use every other day convenience is very important..."],"description":["This Norelco Acu-Control trimmer provides a precise trim with lifetime self-sharpening blades. The flexing guide comb automatically adjusts to facial contours for a close trim even on difficult areas like the throat and chin. Featuring soft-grip panels, the ergonomic design includes a pop-up trimmer and LCD display with battery charge, full and low indicators. Patented Zoom Ring adjusts to 9 length settings (.6\" to .72\") to trim hair precisely and evenly. Includes recharging power cord, guard attachment, cleaning brush and travel pouch. Automatic worldwide voltage adjustment. Imported. 6-1\/2L\"","Perfect for precise, even styling of beard and mustache lengths  from stubble to goatee to medium to full, this trimmer has a ring that  extends or retracts the cutting blades to nine exact lengths: from 0.06  to 0.72 inch. Key to performance is the guide comb, which flexes and  adjusts automatically to facial contours, ensuring that chin and jaw  line are cut the same length as cheeks. Self-sharpening  chromium-steel blades last the lifetime of the trimmer. The head is  hinged for easy cleaning without disassembly. The trimmer works either  cordless or with its power cord and needs to be plugged in for 1 hour  to fully recharge. An LCD screen shows charging status and signals when the unit needs to be recharged.

When it finally arrived I made sure to charge it up (takes a long time initially 6-8 hrs.) then finally tried it on a 2 day stubble.  Well, I wasn't impressed with the shave, it was irritating, uncomfortable, and the gel dispensing gadget was awkward to use.  I decided to give this unit the benefit of the doubt because it does state to give it at least 3 weeks for your skin to grow accustom to shaving by this method.\n\nWell, here I am 3 weeks later and I'm still not impressed with the shave.  I particularly get skin iritation along my neck (burns quite a bit) and it's hard to taper shave near side burns. I've also tried different methods of shaving from: in the shower, over the sink, pre-wash and lubricate with skin lubrication lotion, and just flat out dry shave (very uncomfortable!).  Another minus is the charge does not last very long, the shaver peters out after about 2 shaves of about 5-8 minutes (maybe I have a faulty battery?..) I end up having to charge it often.\n\nI now decided to go back to using a Braun shaver, which I should have purchased in the first place!  My previous one was very good, but i decided to give Norleco a chance...oh well, I guess I'll just have to give it to my nephew - he thinks it looks cool, and he just started shaving!\n\nPros:\n\nUmmm...it looks cool\n\nCons:\n\n-Terrible shave\n\n-weak charge\n\n-lift and cut system is not effective\n\n-very irritating along neck area\n\n-takes long to fully charge\n\n-lubricating feature very awkward to use and can get expensive\n\n-cleaning is tedious\n\nIn my opinion go with a foil system instead like a Braun, Panasonic, or even Remington.  This system is much more effective and although primarily expensive, it will more than make up for the price in a closer shave and not having to buy lubricating lotion, shaving cream and razor blades.","I have been using this razor for a couple of years now and I absolutely love it.

It's very simple to do with some Coconut Oil, Bees Wax, Baking Soda and Essetial Oil. Just google and you can find many great recipes.\n\nThese are quality deodarant cases. The thickness of the walls is on the thin side, so it will hurt if you don't roll up the deodorant high enough and rub the thin edges on your bare skin. The roll mechanism works well. The one significant advantage I found in these when compared to others, is that you pour through the bottom. Most cases you must pour through the top and it has its problems. If your mix is very liquid, it can come spilling through the bottom, as well as sealing the moving mechanism tight. Having this unit upside down and pouring through the bottom makes for a more professional finished product. The top of the deodorant fills the cap below and takes it shape. When you open the hardened deodorant, it has the desired domed shape. Also you control how much you pour from the bottom, filing to the point where it doesn't effect the spinning mechanism.\n\nOverall there are more expensive cases you can get that have a thicker wall, which will be more comfortable to the skin. However for this price point, these cases are the best as you can pour from the bottom.","Nice Quality","I bought this to fill with my homemade deodorant. The first time I filled a couple I didn't realize you had to fill it from the bottom. So I had a hard time twisting it up. But after I realized that I filled it from the bottom.

Use as a safe, natural deodorant for underarm and feet. Bacteria that cause odor can't grow in beeswax!! Natural antihistamine in beeswax also stops itch, burn and sting. Use on insect bites, poison ivy, rashes, burns, etc. Use on skin conditions that exhibit itch, burn or sting or are dry and scaly or red (eczema, psoriasis, rosacea). Use on pet's hot spots to stop itching and scratching and promote rapid healing!! No scent is added to Waterblocker so its scent is that of natural beeswax.

The Gillette Mach3 Power Cartridges have an lubricating strip which will provide you with a visual cue &#8212; it fades to white &#8212; when shave conditions have been reduced. When this happens, you may want to consider changing the blade on your razor.","<b>Will the Gillette Mach3 Power cartridge fit any other razors on the market?<\/b><br>The Gillette Mach3 Power cartridge features a razor blade that fits on any Gillette Mach3 Power, Mach3 Turbo, or Mach3 handle. All Mach cartridges can fit on all Mach handles.","<b>Is it better to use hot, cold, or warm water to shave?<\/b><br>Warm water is best for hydrating beard hair. Soaking in warm water softens hair and causes it to expand, making it 70% easier to cut.","<b>What is the best way to avoid razor burn?<\/b><br>If the skin is not properly prepared before shaving or if the blade on your razor is dull, you are more likely to end up with razor burn. Make sure to hydrate hair in warm water for up to three minutes and apply plenty of shave gel. Also, consider changing the blade on your razor at the first sign of dullness or discomfort.","<b>Is it okay to let my girlfriend or wife borrow my men&#8217;s razor?<\/b><br>For both hygiene and performance, it's not a good idea to share your razor with your partner. Women have a much larger area to shave and you may find that after only a few shaves, your blade has dulled considerably; increasing the likelihood of nicks and cuts. Tell her to try a razor specifically designed for the way a woman shaves, such as Gillette Venus&#174; Embrace&#174;.","<b>Does shaving make your hair grow back thicker?<\/b><br>Scientists at Gillette have conducted extensive testing on the effects shaving has on both male and female hair growth, texture, and color. This testing has proven that shaving does not affect hair growth, color, or texture. Shaving does, however, alter the tip shape of the regrown hair, which may initially change the way hair feels as it grows back. But if hair is left to regrow completely, it will return to its former state.","<b>In what direction should I shave to achieve Gillette&#8217;s best shave?<\/b><br>Men&#8217;s facial hair tends to grow in different directions. Start by shaving with light, gentle strokes with the grain. Then, if necessary, go against the grain for a close shave.","<b>What is the difference between disposable and refillable razors?<\/b><br>The entire razor is discarded when you are through with a disposable razor. With a refillable razor, only the blade cartridge is replaced. Refillable razors like Gillette Fusion ProGlide and Gillette Fusion incorporate more advanced blade technology and ergonomics vs. most disposables for great control and a close comfortable shave.","<b>What are the differences between single, double, triple and 5-blade razors? Which is best?<\/b><br>Gillette's research has demonstrated that single blade technology, which has been applied since 1901, is demonstrably inferior to twin blade shaving systems such as Sensor Excel&#174;, and even more so to 5-blade systems such as Gillette Fusion ProGlide. But the number of blades alone does not ensure a superior shave. The 5-blade shaving surface of Fusion ProGlide Manual and Fusion ProGlide Power features progressive blade alignment, an advanced blade coating process and a flexible comfort guard, which collectively provide Gillette's most comfortable shave.","<b>How do I avoid nicks and cuts, particularly above my upper lip?<\/b><br>The area above the upper lip is tricky for many men. To help avoid nicks and cuts, always leave it for last. Apply plenty of shave gel and allow this area to soak up as much lather as possible.

There is blushing in my cheeks and get lesions around my mouth that scar. It's a pain. So, trying to find a face wash that doesn't send me rushing to find a bowl of ice to stick my face in has been a battle. Many washes I have tried makes me flare, usually within a day. The only one that doesn't is expensive and takes forever to ship. Forget trying to use any sort of brush or scrub to exfoliate so the blackheads on my nose tend to stay right where they are. Well, I have been using this a week and I am friggin' thrilled. The sponge is soft to the skin and leaves a smoothness I haven't felt with any sort of wash or scrub. I use it with the aforementioned wash in the evening to wash my makeup off or in the morning use it as is. Works beautifully both ways. Now, keep in mind this isn't the apricot, walnut type scrub that rips your face apart, this is gentle, feels gentle but gets the job done. Feels like a spa experience. Blackheads are reduced, no flare ups thus far, I feel clean and I feel like I'm glowing. I also bought the \"Selfie Prep\" wash from Castillo Acre and I can't wait to try it but with my skin, to try new things takes some prep..lol. I'm so happy I found this, it's been so hard to find good things for my spazzed out skin.","I love this sponge! I used it both with and without soap.  It left my skin so soft and smooth and I feel it did a good job getting my face clean without being harsh.  It was packaged beautifully and I love the instructions that were printed on a label inside the box.  I would definitely recommend this product and would buy it as a gift for my daughters - great stocking stuffer!","This natural sponge is amazing!  I found it very amusing to see it transform to hard as a rock to a squishy sponge. I was able to use it with a face soap called \"Selfie Prep\" product also made by Castillo Acre. This facial sponge made my face feel fantastic!. I have very sensitive skin even though the sponge exfoliates it is very gentle on the face.

I wash my beard usually with an argan oil soap, then towel dry the beard once done with my shower. I run this comb, or a buffalo horn comb through my beard, to get out the knots and kinks. I love the fact that it comes with the beard comb - and oil. I sincerly appreciate it not leaving my beard dry and leaving it conditioned.","Recently there was a promotional deal and I was got the opportunity to take a look and try this out for myself so that I would provide some feedback and give my opinion here in my review.  This is something I do anyway, so I figured why not. Hopefully my review helps someone make a decision, and if you've got questions, drop a comment afterwards and I'll gladly reply.\n\nI tried this stuff out this morning and it does a decent job of softening my beard without leaving it in a greasy state, so it does that pretty well, the applicator leaves something to be desired, an eyedropper doesn't really work well for this kind of product.  Another one I tried had a little hand pump which was better.  It seems kind of awkward either rubbing an eye dropper on your face or dropping oil into your hand.\nThe smell was not the best.  I'm assuming it is supposed to have no smell, but argan oil and jojoba both have a sharp smell to me that it's exactly unpleasant, but it's not delightful either.\n\nThe comb is not very useful for me, I have a short-ish beard and it seems this would have been more well suited to a longer bushier beard.  I prefer a boar bristle brush for even distribution of product in my beard, even when it is longer.\n\nA few drops of a scented oil would make this a lot better.","This beard oil is made up of a nice combination of oils and works well.  I have been using beard oils for a while and this one works as well as many of the better ones I have bought.  For pretty close to the same price as other beard oils out there you get the comb with it as well.  I'll try to break down each piece in the kit as best I can.\n\nThe oil seems to nourish my beard as well as other beard oils I have used.  This one has castor oil, which I have read is good for eyelashes so I see no reason it will not work with beards.  I followed my normal routine after a shower before applying this beard oil.  I wash my beard usually with an argan oil soap, then towel dry the beard once done with my shower.  I run this comb, or a buffalo horn comb through my beard, to get out the knots and kinks.  I then add the beard oil to my hand about 5 to 10 drops - I have a long beard about 4 to 5 inches long - and apply to the underside of my beard and skin.  I then reload my hands with another 5 to 10 drops and hit the front side of my beard and then, run my fingers through my beard to try to get it as evenly dispersed as possibly.  I then run my comb through - both by this seller - through my beard to work out any knots or kinks I added.  Once done my beard is shiny, not greasy, and lays just right.\n\nFrom my experience, maybe it is the hard water we have here, but It seems all beard oils eventually evaporate or disappear throughout the day.  It might be that I run my hands through my beard so I don't blame the oils for that.  Some oils seem to disappear really quickly, this oil seems to stay a little longer like the other oils I have used.\n\nThe comb is well made and much bigger than I expected.  I have a similar comb, I bought from a different seller, which is significantly smaller and not as well made.  Regarding the comb from this seller, I believe the comb might be made of peach wood.  I expected it to be smaller for some reason, probably because of my other comb, and was pleasantly surprised at the size and how substantial the comb is.  The comb is, sizes are approximates, 5 3\/8\" (138 mm) long by 2\" (51 mm) high by 1\/4\" (7mm) thick along the spine of the comb.  The teeth taper down to about 1\/8\" (3mm) and the usable portion of the comb, teeth, is approximately 4 5\/8\" (118mm).  This comb is stout and holds up well to my long beard.  The brush will continue to darken over time due to the beard oils not only nourishing my beard but also the wood fibers.\n\nI like to run this comb through my beard a few times a day to help keep the kinks and knots down to a minimum.  Plus the comb being made of wood you don't get the static you get with a plastic comb.\n\nFrom what I can tell from the packaging, both the oil and comb are made in China.\n\nAll in all I am pleased with this oil and comb set and would consider buying again in the future."],"description":[],"title":"Beard Comb with Beard Oil 2-in-1 Beard Grooming &amp; Conditioner Set Kit for Men by M2 - Best Beard Care Product Combo makes perfect gift - Wood Comb &amp; Oil with Vitamin E, Aloe Vera, Jojoba Carrier","image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61BYLGdH4yL._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61F8jg5BVDL._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61PYH6f02bL._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51%2BcgpgpmVL._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51U-i8FHBxL._SS40_.jpg"]},{"asin":"B01BBP79SS","reviewText":["Soooooooooo cute but without refill.

I have tough skin, so shaving with a razor never left cuts for me. But it was a mixed blessing, because shaving with a razor, indeed, caused a rather bad acne problem until I switched to waxing for almost two years.\n\nWaxing was great, but a pain to preform -- So I finally decided to spend my birthday money on an electric razor. All my friends insisted I'd regret it, and that they don't work. The whole usual spiel about getting a rash, and just wasting my money. But being the stubborn person I am, I had to find out for myself.\n\nAs usual, my friends were full of it.\n\nFirst of all, not only do I not get acne with an electric razor, *but* I never got any rashes or irriation, even during the first week I used it. I have dark, black facial hair, that is somewhat thinned out due to the waxing. But they're also hard and 'fine'.\n\nThe electric, no, isn't literally as close as a true hand razor. But it's close enough for the conveniance -- It's quicker than a blade for me, and easier since I don't have to sit there digging hairs out of the blades so I could continue shaving.\n\nI run it under warm water when I shave. For the lotion, it's great, but I have to be honest -- I barely use it. I use a pea-sized drop for each side of my face, and then the rest of the experience is all warm water. It works great, though, and I have no complaints. Not to mention that I've been using one lotion pouch for *weeks* now... But I guess I should mention I only need to shave every 2-3 days, not every day. A little stubble never hurt anyone. (And being a musician, I don't have to worry about leaving a good impression on office types.)\n\nOverall I'm surprisingly satisfied. I also admittedly chose this one because it's an awesome green. My only REAL complaint is that, considering the nature of this razor, I can't shave between for my eyebrows. So for this, I've now gotten into the routine of tweezing, if only to avoid the putrid unibrow.","I bought this shaver about a month ago because I'd had enough of cutting myself with my viscious Gillette Mach 3. Three cuts at a time on the cheek. Ouch! The good news is that I have no regrets buying this Cool Skin and I don't think I'll be going back to the Mach 3 any time soon. Like all things tho', pluses and minues:\n\nPluses:\n\n- No more cuts.\n\n- Shaves as close as my Mach 3 with less irritation.\n\n- I can shave in the shower, which is absolutely essential!\n\n- Great looking shaver, and one of the few that doesn't look like my grandfather's. The green color is super cool, and my wife thinks it has even improved the look of our shower!\n\n- Very easy to clean under running water in the shower.\n\n- One charge lasts a week or more.\n\nMinuses:\n\n- Takes about 2 - 3 three times as long as shaving with a razor.\n\n- I don't mind the cost of the Nivea refills that much (see below), it's the waste generated by the empty sachets that bugs me. I wish they could have developed a refillable dispenser.\n\n- The \"advanced LED display\" is pointless. Do I really need a flashing light to tell me to rinse the razor at the end of every shave? Or do I need another light that flashes to tell me I can pump lotion just after the thing's switched on? If it weren't for that great green color I could have bought the cheaper model and got the same functionality at less cost. All you really need is a low battery indicator.\n\n- You pump the lotion or gel onto the heads with your finger or thumb. Using my finger gave me cramp in my hand. Using the thumb is OK. A more advanced design would be to have the lotion delivered automatically.\n\nFinally, what about the lotion and gel? I found both worked fine. At a pinch I've also used ordinary shaving foam and even just water applied directly to my face. The most comfortable and closest shave is however obtained using the gel or lotion. I just bought a 5-pack of lotion at Target for $4.99. One sachet lasts me 4 or 5 shaves if I'm fairly frugal with it. So that works out at about 25c per shave which isn't too bad.\n\nAll in all recommended for those who are thinking of switching from razor to electric.","I ordered this shaver for my husband to replace his older Norelco Quadra. After trying it, we are returning it to Amazon. He says his old Quadra works better than the 7745X Cool Skin. It looks cool and the wet shave is nice but it takes longer to shave and the closeness is not up to expectations. The new shaver should shave as good or better than the older models. The shaver does work so if you don't have an electric shaver, this might be okay for you. My husband has dark, coarse hair and the blades just weren't \"cutting it.\" Fine, light colored hair might improve the performance but, my advice is to look for something else in the same price range.\n\nMaybe our expectations were too high or the shaver really is lacking in performance. There was only one review when we made the purchase and maybe this will help others out there before money is wasted."],"description":["Norelco's Cool Skin Razors can be used in or out of the shower.

My teenage daughter tried to apply them on her nails but they didn't want to stay on at all. Kind of a bummer.\n\nI received this product for free or at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.","I have had experience with Jamberry Nails and this product is very similar except for one big thing. It does not require any heat to apply. The product comes with the sticker sheet with several sizes of nail stickers. It also comes with a set of directions a wooden cuticle pusher and a nail file. The concept is simple. All you have to do is cut the nail sticker to fit your nail and you peel and stick. Any edges that are too long you can use your nail file to precisely cut it along your nail Edge. I was a bit skeptical about this product as it does not require Heat and is basically just a sticker. I have had the product on for a couple days and have not had any lifting or any stickers removed. A couple of the leftovers I cut and put on my daughter's big toes. Which swimming and her bath they have also stage put. One thing I did notice with the skulls is that I put them upside down. The design is facing me instead of facing away from me. I noticed when I was done that the skulls bottom jaw and the school's head should be able to meet when you put your thumb and forefinger together. Also if you cut the sticker a little short from the edges of your nails you cannot tell a big difference. And I was able to easily do this to my right hand with my left and there was no drying time. I received this item at a discounted rate for my honest review.","The nail wraps were too wide for my nails. The part that is supposed to align with your cuticles is way too rounded oddly shaped for my nail bed. It's also like it starts too narrow down there, so there's slight gapping along the edges, then it becomes too wide for my fingers. The instructions were too hard to get out of the package, so I had to shred the packaging just to get to them.\n\n*I received this item at a discount for my honest opinion."],"description":[],"title":"Tattify Skeleton Nail Wraps - Let's Bone (Set of 22)","image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41fOUlQVFxL._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61fzeGdmi8L._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41B9i%2BJhO4L._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41ObjCkCk4L._SS40_.jpg"]},{"asin":"B0181576VG","reviewText":["Cool","Great quality,  came way sooner than expected!

I have been using loofahs and sponges to exfoliate my skin and I have to replace it every two months because it's a favorite breeding place of bacteria. I also use a blackhead or whitehead prick tool and pore strips but I find them ineffective in exfoliating all the unwanted dirt. It also resulted for my pores to get enlarged. With the Le'Edge exfoliator, I can easily remove the dirt off my face and body. It has a blunt stainless steel edge which, at first, I was a little bit skeptical to use because I thought it was gonna hurt but it doesn't as long as you don't rub it too hard against your skin. It really does an effective job. All I needed to do is glide it gently on my skin and it removes excess gunk from deodorants and lotion. It also removes all the whiteheads on my face leaving my skin soft and smooth. I only use this 2 times a week to avoid over-exfoliating my skin. It also doesn't take a lot of time to exfoliate because I am assured that all the dirt is removed from my body and skin. It has a non-slip rubber grip which makes it easier to handle while you are in the shower. This has to be used in the shower or while your skin is warm and your pores is still open from taking a warm bath or shower. It is easy to clean, lightweight and compact so you can bring it with you whenever you go. I highly recommend this body and facial cleaning tool!

Very happy with the whole process from ordering it, to receiving it!  Can't rave enough about this product!","Let me preface this by saying that the colors are pretty and generally well pigmented (I use it with Too Faced Shadow Insurance).  My issue is that many of the colors are very glittery - I like shimmery shadows, but we are talking big chunks of glitter here in several of the colors.  If you're familiar with Urban Decay's \"Midnight Cowgirl\" shadow family you'll get the picture.  Basically the entire palette is gliterry, except for two matte shades. If you get this, make sure to put a tissue under your eyes to catch the fall-out or you'll look like a disco ball.  I'm talking serious fall-out here.\n\nThe colors are:\n\nFull Moon: Glittery Champagne\nNight Light:  Supremely Glittery rosey pink (this one has a chalky texture, making it impossible to apply without massive fallout.)\nSpotlight: Matte Beige\nNightcap: Shimmery medium tan\nAfter Hours:  Chalky glittery medium beige\nMoonstone:  Glittery deep tan\nCocoa Star:  Matte chocolate brown\nEclipse: Glittery Chestnut brown\nNight Fever: Glittery Chocolate brown\n\nThe positives:  The packaging is cute, the colors are fairly pigmented, Too Faced includes looks cards so you can get ideas on looks.\n\nThe negatives:  This is only a good palette if you already have a nice collection of eyeshadow and you want something to throw in your purse when you're going out of town and know you'll be partying (and you have the patience to deal with massive fallout).  You can definitely make some work appropriate looks, but these are more glittery than shimmery, making it a bit juvenile.  Some of the shadows are chalky too. I also have the Urban Decay Naked palette and the colors are MUCH better, as is the quality of the shadows.  Personally I think Naked is also a better deal.  It's $50, so $14 more, but you get more colors, the shadows are better quality (creamier and smoother), and it comes with a nice brush.\n\nI find that I don't use this palette much.  It isn't a palette that has an obvious place in my makeup collection.\n\nUpdated:  I am still experimenting with this palette (I brought it in my makeup bag on vacation and left my UD Naked palette at home) and I've definitely created some nice looks that are completely appropriate for daily life.  I just don't LOVE it.  The problem is, I have the Urban Decay Naked palette.  The colors are similar between UD Naked and TF Natural at Night (warm browns and champagnes) but the Urban Decay colors are shimmers (I love shimmers) and many of the shads in the Too Faced Naked at Night palette are glitters.  That makes the TF colors much harder to work with due to fallout.  Ultimately, this palette is 3.5 stars to me.  It has nice colors and you can create some great looks (provided you put tissue under your eyes to catch the fallout), but the UD Naked Palette is just better in my opinion in terms of pigmentation, ease of application, and blending.","I wouldn't change a thing about this pallet. If you love neutral eyeshadow colors this is for you. It has the perfect mix of shimmer and matte eyeshadow and the packaging is great if you are low on storage."],"description":["Introducing a sultry, nighttime version of our best-selling Natural Eye Collection.

It is not as soft as using cream","This is the raddest shaving serum I've ever used! Kills bacteria, cleans, ensures a smooth shave, and has a pleasant odour. Gentlemen, panties shall drop. This is GOOD STUFF.","A sample was sent to me for test and evaluation purposes.  This man-specific shaving serum is very different from the more familiar shaving foams and gels that my husband normally buys.  For a start, the airless pump container requires priming the pump, meaning you have to expel all the air out of the bottle before the contents start to come out in any quantity.  Once done, the fairly viscous clear gel is delivered in short burst.  Although tempted to pile it on thickly, my husband started with an amount similar to an almond and found it to be quite sufficient to address a week-old growth.\n\nI felt the consistency of the serum applied to damp skin, and it reminded me more of a face cream than a shaving product, but I have to say, the razor was gliding very easily, leaving behind soft, smooth, bare skin.  Once the shaving was done, a little rinsing with clear water produced a milky white residue which was quickly absorbed.  The scent is delicious, a little sweet until body chemistry adapts it, but I detected vanilla and some of the lighter herbal elements.\n\nThe ingredients include some lovely botanical compounds like rice bran oil, sunflower oil, extracts of yarrow, peppermint, melissa and mallow, vitamin E and coumarin, a phytochemical responsible for the vanilla-like scent.  The blurb says it's a multi-purpose product that can also be used as a face wash and moisturizer, so it would be useful on a trip when luggage space is at a premium, but my husband is going to use it strictly for shaving, since there is also a very creamy moisturizer in the range.  If you find it a bit pricey, consider that the 50 g will last you a lot longer than comparable gels based on artificial soapy compounds.  This brand does not test on animals and is committed to natural ingredients as far as possible; I appreciate the honesty and the intent."],"description":["<b>Our Nutsack & Hoof Shaving Serum is a multitasking product for all you Dudes.

However, they ended being put to greater use than I thought they would! Unfortunately, my oldest daughter and I have been plagued with sun (fever) blisters from being out in the sun without proper lip protection during Kong softball practices. We had a little jar of some medicated lip balm that is for healing and lip protection, but it does not come with any applicators. Generally, we would use a cotton swab to apply said lip balm, but wouldn't you know it, we happened to be out! Well, since these had arrived a couple of days before hand (bad right on time might I add!), I decided we would try them instead. There are plenty, so no one has to share and cross contaminate, and they are SO MUCH softer than using a cotton swab! The tips are just perfect for a soft and smooth application to the lips. I will certainly not go back to using cotton swabs, especially when I'm applying to sore or sensitive lips. I love them even more than I thought I would!

This is a true after shave lotion classic. Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.\n\nThere slogan was \" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN \" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.\n\nThe only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.\n\nAt any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.\n\nNote :::; Some reviewers mention this 7oz size now comes in a plastic container, I just bought one in Wal-Mart and it was glass.","I love Aqua Velva and have used it over 20 years but I tell you the truth I hate your new 7 oz bottle of plastic or whatever it is, give me the glass one back.

The silicone strips worked well but were more effective in the beginning but not so much after. Tried gels, creams and no sign of a difference. I have been trying this for 4 weeks and alas, I have seen a differencethis one is more in line with an oil and smells niceactually reminds me of the smell of a Church. Works well and absorbs nicely in the skin like oil wouldyou need to massage it into the skin for about 2 minutes, twice a day. I have seen a significant difference in that area, and now I am more opt to try it on stretch marks by my arms to see if it will have the same effect. For me this has proven to show a significant difference and I will update in 4 weeks of my continued progress...so far very pleased!!! Thank you Elrique for making my ugly scar less noticeable!!\n\nI purchased ColCutem Serum Big 4 OZ  bottle at NO COST in exchange for my honest review. The above stated is all my own opinion based on my experience using this on my scars for the last 6 weeksI was not told what to write nor did any person, seller or vendor influence my thoughts. I will never exchange: reimbursement, gift cards or any other form of compensation of any kind for a positive review. I will not remove a negative review if requested by a seller or vendor nor do I have any hesitations of posting a 1, 2, 3 or 4 star-rating should this item rightfully merit it. I do however, reserve the right to edit my review at any time, should the product fail or its usability\/quality deteriotes after frequent uses.","I am a mother of three children so I'm sure you can imagine the stretch marks that have accumulated on my sides and stomach over the years. I was a bit skeptical because I mean seriously some of these stretch marks are 26 years old so I was thinking they are never going to do anything to make them look better. I've been using the ColCutem Scar and stretch mark serum for about 2 weeks. I'm not going to say that my stretch marks are disappearing but they do seem lighter and the redness seems to be fading. You'll have to take my word for it because there's no way I'm taking a picture of them :) .\nThe serum is not sticky it does feel a bit early when you first put it on your skin and you definitely do need to rub it in for a few minutes as they Direct on the bottle but once it's absorbed into your skin it leaves it very soft. And the scent is actually not bad it has more of a natural floral scent to it not a medicated stent. I'm looking forward to the continued use see if the stretch marks do start to fade more.\n\nThis is a 4 ounce bottle with a nice pump that distributes the serum. You don't need to use a lot of it like I said I have stretch marks on my sides and my belly from babies and two squirts are definitely enough to cover cover the whole area. I'm assuming if it can give me this type of reaction to my older stretch marks that it may possibly work better for more recent stretch marks\n\n***This I don't was received at no cost in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion.

I recevied s set of the Clear Glass Refillable 8 Oz Bottles to review.  I have been using natural products to clean and do other household tasks for some time, but it only been in the last few months that I have been exploring mixing things to create powerful cleaners, air fresheners and laundry aids. These are great bottles for many many things. The glass is thick and durable. One of the things I have used in them is water with lavender essential oil. I use this to spray the mattresses when we strip the sheets off. I don't saturate the mattress, but just spray over it and let the mist settle onto it. I also spray it into the air in our bedrooms a few times a week. These beat the cheap plastic bottles that have sprayers that break or mysteriously stop working from one use to the next. I also like using peppermint oil in water for a fresh, energizing room spray (also good for dusting to remove and discourage spider webs!).  The chalk labels are practical for remember what you have mixed up and for what purpose. They wash clean so you can change the label anytime you change the contents.\nThese are perfect for mixing up a nice amount that will last a bit, but not so much that you might need to pour it out for something new. The trigger feels a little odd at first because it has an almost up and down movement versus the back and forth movement of most triggers. There is a button lock on the neck the trigger that locks and unlocks it . One thing they don't have that is usually an option on most triggers, is there is no spray adjustment to switch between a stream or fine spray. It is a mist\/fine spray.\nI am loving using glass bottles over plastic very much. It takes a little extra care not to break them, but it's worth it. These can be used over and over again with out worry the material breakdown that plastic has and glass does contain any of the harmful chemicals of plastic.","I'm quite impressed with the clear glass refillable spray bottles. To be honest, the main reason I wanted these was for the bottles, not so much the labels. I don't have chalk so I can't really use them. Instead I used other labels that I had. The bottles are a great size for DIY cleaning spray. I mixed vinegar and water for a multi-purpose spray. The sprayer works fairly well. I really like that these bottles are glass because it'll allow you to reuse them many times. It makes it easier to clean the bottles out, too. The chalk labels seem decent, but for me, they won't be used.\n\nOverall, I'm impressed with the clear glass refillable spray bottles and would definitely recommend them. There's so many uses for these bottles.\n\nI did receive these bottle in exchange for honest opinion.

It was rated high and its price was half of the leading razor.  I also crossed check the price against other retailers and Amazon.com was [less expensive] and shipped one day sooner.\nI have a tough beard that grows fast coupled with a tender face.  My Remington 300 was the first razor to allow me to use an electric shaver and make it through the day without looking like a beatnik; however, after 5 years the screens are impossible to find so it was time for a new shaver.  The new Braun came as advertised and was charged up the very first time in only 4 hours versus 14 for my old 300.  The charged and low charge lights are handy and the ability to charge a dead razor for a shave in 3 minutes is a great advantage.  I have found in the past that a preshave liquid improves the closeness of the shave and that has been true with the Braun as well.  By the third day my face had adjusted to the shaver and I am getting the closest shave ever with no skin irritation.  The shaver also does a great job with neck hairs and the occasional long hair.  One significant reason that I selected this razor was the changing of the screen and cutters at 18 months.  My old 300 required a screen or screen\/cutter replacement every 6 months so this saves $30 over that 18 month period.  When selecting a razor be sure to pay attention to this or any \"self-cleaning\" liquids that you have to purchase on a regular basis.  The 6520 uses a floating head but is switchable to lock the head for hard areas like under the nose.  I found that I still get the best shave by moving my hand against the grain of the hair before I run the shaver there and you will want to shave against the grain too.  This was required with my old 300 and is indicative of most foil razors.  This is not required of rotary shavers but most research that I read indicates that a foil provides a closer shave.\nI am very happy with this razor.  It works great!","Braun 6520 is the best electric shaver made. I've tried a\nRemington and it is junk, you get a excellent smooth shave,\njust as good as a razor blade. I recommend the Braun 6520, to\nall men that are using razor blades, you will never use a razor blade again.","Most men say that the only way to get rid of those neck hairs is with a rotary razor. It's NOT TRUE! I get an excellent and thorough shave every mourning. I've tried the rest, but Braun is the BEST! One charge seeems to last forever. I take it camping with me for a week or so ....no problem."],"description":["This electric razor has a head that oscillates from side to side at high speed and pivots to adjust to the face's contours. In addition, the razor offers a three-stage cutting system and delivers a smooth shave either with or without a cord. The razor has a pop-up trimmer for mustache and sideburns and works worldwide on 110- to 240-volt systems. It recharges fully in one hour for 60 minutes of shaving time or charges in three minutes for a quick shave. The three-stage cutting system consists of a cutting block between two foils, with each unit performing individually as the razor runs across the face. For difficult shaving areas, such as under the nose, the pivoting head locks into position.

I like to review everything I buy because I feel like people need to know what they're getting themselves into, but I mean, these extensions are a puzzle to me.  So here's the good:  They're very pretty, soft, and easy to dye (darker) in order to match to your natural color.  You can use light heat to make them pretty.  I'm a fan of all that.\n\nThe bad: I tried to put these things in my very short hair, by myself, at 2am.  It was a hair massacre of epic proportions.  I messed up so badly. I don't blame the hair extensions for my own stupidity though.  I mean, it's not their fault I'm a moron.  It is their fault, however, that the tape sucks.  A lot.  and that you're basically going to have to cut the bottom two inches off the extensions in order to not look like an 80's beach bunny.  They're kind of gross, man.\n\nThe end result: I pulled them out (along with a lot of my own hair).  I decided to go with clip ins until my hair was longer.  I did keep the extensions and will get better tape for them. Now that the bottoms are trimmed, they're actually very pretty, so it would be a waste not to keep them.  I'll use them once I have someone to help me put them in and NOT butcher my hair.","I love love love these! While they are not super thick ...they are perfect my needs.  I change my hair color every few months.. I keep my hair length just below my shoulders use just one set to fill but two sets for a fuller look. I have dyed them ..myself...to match my color. Now I can just switch out sets when I get bored or want an ombr look.  They are not heavy..which is perfect because I have fine hair and these blend beautifully with my hair texture. If you have never used tape in extentions before.. I highly recommend these as a starter set..so you can get the feel for wearing these. For the price..it's an excellent value and surprisingly beautiful shinyhair....so if you don't like it..at least you haven't spent hundreds on something you won't use.  Also..they curl beautifully!!","Although these were much better than the expensive ones I bought the tape still did not hold up through the first shower iPhone load every instruction including sulfate free shampoo you and waiting to wash my hair the tape still did not hold although we did hold much better than the hundred dollar ones that I bought prior to this. I purchased some tape separate Lee and I'm going to try something different I will post a separate review and I'm going to use these extensions with that separate tape and I will let you all know how it works the hair again is of great quality I will say that .

I had a Quadra before and upgraded myself to this shaver. It's been about 3 weeks since I've used the 9160xl and it's been good so far. I did have a couple of weeks adjustment phase even though I was using my Quadra (maybe the technique I use). It was irritating in the cheeks area initially but now have got adjusted, it's cool. The major improvement is in the jaw and neck region, not at all irritating and the sensitive modes do help. I think the Smarttouch is a plus than the SpeedXL models (again that is at a personal level), I feel it's easier on the wrist.","I've been a Norelco user for several years now. I have a thick beard, and am always looking for an electric razor that can give me the convenience and close shave. When you figure that a Gillette razor with all those blades you have to keep replacing, an electric razor can actually save you money from the conventional shave. My first Norelco was a Reflex that I inherited from my grandfather. It was pretty old, so its rechargable batteries died. The Quadra series came out, so I tried switching to that. I found it did give me a closer shave because the heads were flexible and could better fit the contours of my face. It worked fine, and then the Spectra came out. The differences between the Quadra and the Spectra are not great. The main thing is that the Spectra has a sensitivity dial (with my beard, I always have to have it set to the highest setting....which is pretty much like the Quadra). It supposedly has different heads....the blades are exactly like the Quadra and the slots are slightly different. Basically, there isn't a big difference between the two with shaving. I did find that one benifit of the Spectra was that you can use it as a corded razor while it's recharging (the Quadra and Reflex only run on batteries....so when the battery dies, you pretty much have to chuck the razor).  I can honestly say Norelco has seriously upgraded with the smart touch system. Each head has twice as many blades....with 3 rows instead of one. The heads also sit on a cradle that rocks back and forth. So it can reach any pesky curve or crevice on your face. It's certainly worth plunking down the money if you have a heavy beard and are looking for a close shave from an electric razor.","Got mine about a month ago...\n\nPositives:  I'm still on my first charge, so battery is good so far.  Shaves slightly better than my older Norelco.\n\nNegatives:  The rubbery surface does not feel as comfortable as my old one in my hand.  Hair stubs get stuck on the rubber surface, and are harder to clean off. The entire blade assembly comes apart from rest of shaver - be careful when you first clean it, as I didn't expect it and dropped it.  I don't know why, but I often get a handful of hair stubs when I shave.  That's kind of annoying.\n\nConsidering that you can get an older model for half the price, I would say save the money and get a cheaper model."],"description":["Norelco's New SmartTouch-XL combines two revolutionary technologies to shave more with each pass: 1.

The entire item is three pieces: one piece is the actual medicine compartments, and the other two pieces are the lids.\n\nAs it is, it's not what I was expecting, but it will do the job of holding a week of meds separated into day\/night doses, or two weeks of meds if you keep each day's meds in one compartment.

It has a compartment for each day of the week with both an AM and PM slot.

My wife likes to take many supplements and vitamins and such as well as her normal prescriptions, and this product allows her to keep better track of if she has taken her morning or night pills.  Each compartment is capable of holding several pills of varied sizes.  Her only comment is that she wishes that the two colors were more separated ( this one is clear purple and clear blue).  She said it would be better with red and blue or something more distinguishing but since it also has AM and PM labels printed on each compartment that this is not really a problem.  I have noticed that the compartments are easily opened.  This could be both a good and bad thing.  If you were to drop this pill box full of pills, they would likely go everywhere.

It was wonderful stuff, made your mouth feel amazingly clean.  Then they sold the company to Zand.  I bought two tubes of the new version.  They were like tubes filled with leather.  No way to soften them up, no way to squeeze anything out.  I sent them back.  I called the company later to ask if they had fixed the problem.  They gave me some story about how \"at the end of a run\" it tended to be thicker and they were going to change the formula, blah blah.  My question is, why did they change it in the first place from the excellent product it used to be?  So now I buy Tea Tree Therapy Baking Soda toothpaste.  It's quite good, and reasonably priced too, but not the really superior product SilvaFresh used to be.

There's more of a peppermint flavor, and less of the slightly \"oily\" feeling that the previous version left in your mouth right after brushing (probably something most people couldn't get used to and a reason to change the recipe, although it was ok once you got used to it). This Zand formula still does a pretty good job of addressing oral health issues  - it seems to leave your mouth feeling clean and fresh.

These are exactly the same and an absolute steal at the price the company is asking.\n\nThe box comes with 8 wraps and envelopes with the mix and bandages. There is a little DIY to this whole process. You have to soak the bandages it comes with in boiling water for 10-15 minutes and stir the powder in the envelopes until it forms a paste. Once you have achieved the desired consistency  you paint the mix onto your skin where you are going to place the bandages. It is fairly simple. You leave it on for 45-60 minutes for maximum results. Then take a shower and wash off!\n\nYou have to reuse the bandages the box provides. You can machine wash them or hand wash them and hang dry to prevent shrinkage. I was able to use all the bandages and I am a fairly large girl. They covered my body just fine.\n\nThe wraps work well and provided a toned look to my physique. It is almost like wearing SPANX but without the SPANX! I did these wraps before I went out for the night in a little dress and I looked a few pounds lighter. The box lets you know to use these for six weeks straight and then once a month for maintenance. Overall, they are totally worth the price you are paying for the novelty and the fact that these DO work. 5\/5 stars!\n\nIf you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

I assumed the people who wrote those reviews were over-reacting, probably not using the product correctly, or have bad nails to start with.  Every day now, as I look at my badly damaged nails, I'm so sorry I didn't believe the reviews.\n\nThe Kiss nails are beautiful, can be filed down to the preferred size and shape (yes, even if pre-colored) and the pre-colored nails never chipped or faded and always looked like they had just been applied.  They came in a comfortable length too.  I was ready to make this my new habit.\n\nWhile wearing the nails, I noticed my nail beds were painful for the first day or two.  I assume this is from the pressure of an artificial nail pulling the natural nail into a shape that wasn't the same as it was attached to my finger.  It stopped hurting after 2 days.\n\nThe first week, three of the nails fell off.  The second week, 5 of the nails fell off.  I used the glue (not the stickers) and did everything as instructed so it was frustrating to have this happen.\n\nI only applied two nail sets, for 5-6 consecutive days each time with a 4-day rest between.  When I took  off the second set, it was obvious I could never wear them again.  After wearing my second set for 6 days, I was stunned to find three nails that had partially turned green (pseudomonas).  I knew immediately that the reviews were right and I could never wear the nails again.  The green faded somewhat after a week, using alcohol on the nails daily to cure the infection.\n\nTwo months have passed since that time, and my natural nails have continued to split and crumble.  Now there is no white area left of my nails, and they continue to crumble.  I can't trim a snagging nail because all that is left is attached to the nail bed.  One nail with green still visible will stay that color until that section of the nail grows out.\n\nListen to the reviews  don't destroy your nails with this product, or you'll have the same kind of regrets that I do.","So the trick to any press on nail set, is to file the nails to size of each nail. I file the sides to go parallel perfectly with my nail shape, and then with these, I cut the corners and file down to make a more oval shape. I'm not a big fan of square nails at the moment and I need my nails short for playing keyboards rn so I don't mind that I lose some length.\n\nI also do NOT use the \"adhesive\" stickers the nails come with. The are gummy and have found come off easier than just using the glue straight to nail. Also I have less nail damage when popping them off.\n\nThey last 2-3 weeks easily.. just expect a few to pop off here and there, but I always carry the little glue stick around w me just in case and don't mind having to put one or two back on. After a few weeks, removal is very easy. The glue usually gets old and you can pick them off easily without acitone or any removers. And I have found these nails are A MILLION times less damaging to my natural nails compared to gels or acrylics done at a salon. Plus a million times less expensive too!\n\nOnly takes me about 30 mins to size up my nails (I now actually know my size numbers for each finger for this brand which makes it very easy), file them to size and glue them on.\n\nBIG TIPS IN LONG LASTING WEAR!!!\n1) never pick a nail size that's too small for ur nail.. it WILL pop off. Make sure when choosing a size, the whole service sits on the surface of your nail easily without pushing down\n\n2) prime your nails by filing\/cutting down, and wiping nails with rubbing alcohol to remove and dirt or oil from your skin that will loosen the bond between your nail and the glue quicker.\n\n3) do NOT over-glue. Thinly coat the glue directly on the nail, and apply nail on top. Then, make sure you have a clean finger that didn't get any glue on it or it will smudge on top of ur pretty new nail, and press and hold down nail while glue adhears for 30-60 seconds, applying pressure to the whole serface of the nail.\n\nAnd you'll be lookin cuteeeee! These r the best nail solutions I've come across. Press on nails in general have changed my life.\n\nSo the last pic u see, the nail cracked a bit. These nails are a bit more thin and natural which is nice.. I like that delicate look, but I'm always very hard on my nails, so just be careful when cleaning or working!

When the hair clippers quit I knew it was time to get a new one. The results have been fantastic. This electric groomer gets closer than the hair clippers did and with the other attachments it gets better results than my first Norelco. I use the product for shaving my face and head before I use blades and it's made it a lot easier. Being able to use it without keeping it plugged in all the time is also a big plus. Seeing that I shave my head too I haven't used the hair clipper attachment on myself, but got fair results when using it on my nephews who have pretty thick hair. I'm able to use the groomer 3-4 times before I have to recharge it. My opinion, you can't go wrong with this product for this price so why pay more for other similar products.","...turns out, i didn't.  this compact and versatile product does everything it promises and does it well.  i can't attest to how it compares to similar, more expensive products, but i don't need to: there are plenty of attachments, the battery life is good, and it carries out all the grooming tasks flawlessly.  can't beat the value!","I bought this last December, so Ive been using it for 8 months now.  I don't grow a beard, so I've been using it to cut my hair instead.  It saved me money from going to the barber because I like my hair short, since my hair is thin it doesn't look right when it's long, so I cut short very often with these trimmers. It works out good.  The only problems are that:\n\nyou cannot use it when plugged in,\n\nit may run out of power on you,\n\nyou must remove trimmings from comb often due to its \"cupped\" design\n\nyou must be very careful about the blue plastic head because it is very flimsy and it will break if you drop it.\n\nI recommend removing and storing the plastic head somewhere.  I just broke mine, and I need to get warranty service for it.  I guess overall, it saved me time and money.  Instead of going to the barber for an hour and spending money every 4 weeks, I bought this cheap trimmer and cut my hair myself in 30 minutes.\n\nIt's not the best, but it's cost efficient for me."],"description":["Norelco's Multi-Trim offers all the tools needed to trim beard and moustache, hair on your head, nose, ears, eyebrows, neckline and sideburns."],"title":"Philips Norelco G270 Multi-Trim All Purpose Groomer","image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41H653WS75L._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/415WSFAY82L._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/31P9RNHES7L._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41WE3DMAWGL._SS40_.jpg"]},{"asin":"B00P1J81Z6","reviewText":["A tad small and don't stay up much, but love them.","Description wrong.

I hate that \"squeeky-clean\" sound, and the tangling of my thick curly hair. This bar gets my (and my thicker haired daughter's) scalp and hair clean without drying it out. I even used it on my Virgin Indian Remy weave hair, and it didn't require conditioning, afterward.","The first time I used this shampoo bar, I really didn't like the way it made my hair feel, tangled and kind of greasy.  But I had heard your hair or scalp has to adjust to shampoo bars so I kept using it.  After a few days I have really come to love how soft and manageable my hair has become. It also leaves your body nice and moisturized and so smooth too!  I also use the Tasmania conditioner bar just on the ends of my hair and it compliments this bar very nicely.  No tangles, soft and bouncy hair!  I am a blonde, which has been damaged by highlighting my more brassy dirty blonde natural hair color and it was really in bad condition.  Most shampoos will further dry out my hair, this bar doesn't at all and it does have a pleasant clean scent, nothing overpowering just a hint of a fruity or citrus scent.  It looks like I barely used it so it will last a long time, just be sure to keep it out of the shower when not using it or it may melt (especially the conditioning bar).  Overall I love both products and would order again.  Still waiting on my Lush order to see if they are worth the heftier price tag.

All designed to work perfectly in tandem. About the Artist: Russ Abbott is a pioneer. Since he began his tattooing career in 1997, Abbott has become a leader in the American Illustrative tattooing movement. But Abbott is not an easy artist to classify. His tattoos are spectacular pastiches, incorporating subjects from literature and American folk art, baroque stylistic flourishes, and sacred geometries. The constant in Abbotts work is his understanding and application of color theory. The scope of his palette is evident in many of his large illustrative pieces, which demonstrate both his eye for color and his tremendous technical aptitude. Abbott has also been a vocal advocate for the role of digital design and layout in tattooing. He does much of his tattoo design work- from mandalas to outdoor scenes- on computers and has proven the role of software in visualizing tattoos on the body. Abbott owns and tattoos out of Ink & Dagger Tattoo in Georgia, and travels internationally to educate fellow tattooers as well as the general public."],"title":"Russ Abbott - RED Tattoo Stencil Sampler 25 Sheets of Transfer Paper, 25 Transfer Gels, 25 Tattooing Gels","image":["https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51yIvFh7gWL._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/61sHE3rGd0L._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51p0nVZ38tL._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41r5ekrWqzL._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51j-Knyc5mL._SS40_.jpg","https:\/\/images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/6114o2OjV8L._SS40_.jpg"]},{"asin":"B01DSUSOV0","reviewText":["This was a GREAT product.

Huge mistake! I returned it after 2 shaves and bought this razor and was hooked during the first use of it. The pivoting heads easily and snugly fit the contours of your face and it gave an excellent first shave that will only get better as the blades break in over the next few weeks. The color is a bit odd and it seemed to take the hand of god to get the trimmer open but those are my only complaints.\n\n Rotary razors don't work for every type of beard but they work well for me and this is the best I have ever owned. Norelco forever!","It gave me a razor burn sooooooooooooooo bad my girlfriend asked if Satan grabbed my face!","Though this is one of the models in the \"lower\" groups of Norelco's offerings, it has more than enough bells and whistles.  I really can't see why anyone would need more.  My first shave with this razor ended with the best shave I have ever had in my life.  Just read on and follow all the suggested steps.\nNorelco instructs us that all razors of this model should be fully charged for 4 hours before the first shave. I believe that all of Norelco's razors are given if not a full charge, a partial charge.  The manual also explains about the LED lights that indicate the percentage of charged power available to the razor.  When I plugged my razor in for charging, before using, it said 40% available and the 60% indicator was blinking (meaning not quite 60% full).  Give the razor a full 4 hour charge, even if the LEDs say 100% in about 1 hour or so.  Go the full 4 miles the first time around (remember, this razor has a quick charge function, so it may appear to be fully charged, it isn't, it's just your quick charge at work).  I washed my face with plenty of soap and soaked my whiskers with a lot of water.  Then I dried my face completely.  Then, contrary to what Norelco says, I used a liquid preshave conditioner.  Not a gel, not a powder (which should never be done with these razors), simply a liquid.  Then I shaved - - - and it was the best shaving experience I have ever had.\nThe LED lights tell me everything I need to know - - 20%, 40%, on up to 100% power available.  It starts blinking red at 20% power left.  You can still shave; it's just letting you know that you need to charge it up.  It does have the sideburn trimmer, which I have used and it performed wonderfully for me.\nIf this is the \"lower\" line, I don't know what you can do with the higher lines.  I do not see any need for something beyond this razor.  It has its cleaning brush for the razor heads, it has its charging cord, it has its neat little traveling pouch that holds the razor and all its accessories.  What more do you need?\nIt feels comfortable and well balanced in my hand, it is very quiet, and it is a pleasant razor to look at.

I have used both the patchouli and the lemon soaps. These soaps are unique in that they can be assembled like Lego blocks so that there is a pumice (exfoliating) side and a nourishing, super-fatted, moisturizing side. The pumice side is gentle, and can be safely used even over bony areas such as the collarbone without irritating sensitive skin. The moisturizing side is beyond compare for its qualities. When you use it, it doesn't feel like it all rinses off - be assured that it does, that sensation is just the extreme moisturization taking effect! Afterward, my skin feels smoother, more moisturized, and silkier for the rest of the day. This wonderful texture increases with just a little additional everyday moisturizing lotion, but it really is due to the soap.\n\nDon't let the price tag fool you. This soap is just incredible, and I really never thought I'd say this, but it's worth the cost!\n\nAdditionally, this gift box is so lovely, truly a beautiful presentation, with the soaps, which are over wrapped, enclosed in elegant sleeves with hand-tied black satin ribbons. For a lovely, unique, and beneficial gift, this is an outstanding choice! The pricing reflects a substantial savings over the individually packaged pricing, too.\n\nTreat yourself or someone you care about to the finest soap they'll ever enjoy.

Indigo Wild is focused on producing and distributing high quality, handmade, all natural goods. All natural raw materials make up each product.

I first tried the vitamin e oil, and after feeling encouraged by the results of that product, I wanted to give this cleanser a try. I have had rather bad acne for some time (since middle school), and now that I am in my mid 20s I have been really searching desperately for something to help reduce my acne. Other products I've tried in the past for acne have generally been quite typically chemically based, and usually have not helped much to reduce my acne much at all, and have also very often caused more discomfort (redness, itchiness, or similar reactions). So I was really glad to see a more natural based product. I've been using this cleanser for about two weeks now, and it has been great. It hasn't caused any negative reactions at all, and instantly helps remove the excess oiliness from my skin without drying it out or causing redness like other products. It is very gentle, and my face always feels so refreshed after using it. Very pleasant! In terms of my acne, while it of course has not caused it to disappear completely or shown a particularly dramatic improvement thus far, I do really feel that it is making some difference. My skin and face feel calmer and less inflamed to me. I wash my face with it in the morning and evening and also occasionally use the vitamin e oil to moisturizer my skin in the evenings. I think that it will continue to make at the very least a subtle difference in helping my acne, and certainly seems very promising in terms of keeping my face and skin more healthy. My face also seems to feel very noticeably softer and smoother since I began using this cleanser (and also the vitamin e oil). So I am very pleased and plan to purchase more!!

But--the shaver body is light weight and flimsy feeling and fits slightly awkwardly in my hand--its tapered body always wants to shift downwards and I end up holding it close to the shaving heads and then press too heavily; it sounds like a wind up toy; the trimmer is silly in terms of size, efficiency and convenience. Probably if I'd seen this razor it in a retail store and had the opportunity to get its 'hand feel' I wouldn't have bought it. The Norelco 'Jame Bond' surpasses this model across the board. I have another 40+ days and still may return the 1060, but every time I use it I continue to enjoy it\n3+ stars worth and will likely keep it. But I encourage buyers not to forget the easy return policy and hold on to your original sales receipt to keep all options available.","The development of the arcitec shaver began as a challenge from Phillips' management to its engineers to create a razor that would finally convince users of conventional razors to turn electric. Although the shaving closeness does not match that of a Gillette razor 100% (and perhaps no electric shaver ever will), the results are considered stunning and revolutionary for an electric razor. The design and build are also very modern and trendy, and its an overall worthwhile investment for frequent travelers or anyone who dislikes wet shaving."],"description":["Norelco is evolving into Arcitec and it's a wonderful experience for your face.

Three individually flexing shaving heads are connected by a ball joint system making them swivel, rotate, and pivot with a full range of motion. The maneuverability allows <b>arc<\/b>itec to adjust to the contours of your face ensuring optimum skin contact and a closer shave -- even on the neck.

While at home, you can recharge your razor in its sleek stand and show off this modern addition to your bathroom shelf.","For those sideburns, goatees and moustaches, the new patented precision tube trimmer cuts hairs closer to the skin.

But since that is not a good thing when writing a review, I will try to be verbose instead.\nI have very sensitive skin and because of this, shaving has always been a real chore. Even with the best manual razors from Gillette, the Mach 3 or even the Schick Protector and FX (both tripled bladed also), I could never achieve a close confortable shave. A couple of years ago I decided to give up the blade and try an electric razor. I did all my research and at that time, at least via Consumers Guides, EPINIONS, and other web sites the top of the line Panasonic got top reviews. So I bought one. Boy what a mistake that was for me. It never gave me a close shave and after about 18 months, of use, I had to repace the blade and foil which was about 50% of the cost and this lead me to my new NORELCO Advantage.\nWow, What a difference! The instructions stated it would take 3 weeks for the hair on my face to  get trained to the Norelco method, but not in my case. My first shave was PERFECT...Even those hard to reach places; like under your lips or below the adam's apple  came out hairless. I could never achieve results like this with the other razors, blade or electric. And although some might think that having the built in preshave is a gimmick, I like it, it is one less thing to pack when you are traveling, and its there in a pinch, without loosing your shaving momentum. And since I never plan on growing a beard or mustache, the multi beard controls of the other Norelcos did not appeal to me. So guys, if you have any fathers day money left over, I highly suggest giving your face a break and trying one.","Good razor for the price.","Every face is different and I tried this Norelco both wet and dry but it did not give me a close shave at all. Admitedly I have a tough beard and sensitive skin so between the two I had a lot of razor burn and more stuble than reasonable. I ended up buying the Panasonic LT-41 and for my face it is wonderful. ALmost no burn and the closet shave I've ever had with an electric shaver - darn near as good as a top of the line blade.\n\nIf the Norelco works for your face shape and beard then great. I would not recommend it without a 3-week test drive as I don't think it's all that great of shaver. The gel is expensive too and it didn't deliver for me."],"description":["Norelco's Advantage Wet \/ Dry Shaving System, can be used dry or in the shower, for unsurpassed comfort and closeness, Bonus Steam-Free Mirror included!","Looking for a cordless shaver that offers a clean shave in any environment?

Don't waste your money, please.","I really like this hair clip. Its not to heavy once in the hair, its easy to snap on, and it stays put. Its really cute! The ONLY issue is the crystals: they fall out like crazy. Two came out during shipping, and 4 came out when I put it in. It's not a huge deal- its barley noticeable and I do have replacement crystals- but for $11, I didn't expect that many to fall out. Also, be VERY careful when you place this in your hair. The ring and index \"fingers\" are unsupported and can be flimsy. I bent the index finger by pushing it to hold clip the piece, when I should have put pressure on the middle finger (its attached to the clip). The finger went back into place, but some crystals fell out because of the bending. Other than that, it is very pretty, and I got lots of compliments while out!\n\nUPDATE: After using it about 6 times, the index finger completely broke off! It is extremely fragile. And pretty much all the crystals are gone, even the ones I replaced. I knocked it down a star because of this.

It's a soft, spongy rubber type material. I set aside 30 minutes or so to do a rough cut, then work it down into the denture. I then bite down on it for 10 minutes or so and then trim the excess on the outer edges and wear the dentures for the rest day. By the next day I know the cushion has bonded with the denture and I can then use adhesive (I prefer cream over powder). The cushion lasts me a month for the top and 2 weeks for the bottom.
